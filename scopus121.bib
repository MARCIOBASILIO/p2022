abstract={BACKGROUND: Radiomics can be used to quantify image heterogeneity. Whether radiomics can be used to screen out features such as fingerprint from MRI images of osteoporotic vertebral bodies to predict the occurrence of new fracture is worth studying. OBJECTIVE: To explore the feasibility of constructing a machine learning prediction model for thoracolumbar refracture after vertebral augmentation through combining MRI radiomics features and clinical information. METHODS: This study retrospectively collected the data of patients who were diagnosed with osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture by MRI and treated with percutaneous vertebral augmentation in Chengdu First People’s Hospital from May 2014 to April 2019. PyRadiomics was used to extract the imaging features of T1 sequences of vertebral MRI at the T11-L2 segments before percutaneous vertebral augmentation. All models were constructed in the training set, and prediction performance evaluation was performed in the validation set. Feature dimension reduction was conducted by applying least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. The corresponding refracture prediction models were constructed by multivariate logistic regression, random forest and adaptive lifting algorithm analysis using clinical parameters, selected features or the integrating of both. The diagnostic efficacy of the model was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve. The decision analysis curve was used to compare the clinical value of each model. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) A total of 336 vertebrae were included in 135 patients, of which 67 vertebrae had refractures. 1 746 features were extracted from each vertebra, and 13 important features were obtained through dimension reduction. (2) Among the three models, area under curve of the combined model in the training set and validation set was significantly higher than that of the clinical model (P < 0.05), and the decision analysis curve also showed that the net benefit of the combined model in predicting thoracolumbar refracture was higher than that of the clinical model in most threshold intervals. (3) The results indicated that it was feasible to construct a refracture prediction model based on MRI T1 sequence imaging and clinical information, which could help to identify the vertebrae with high risk of refracture at early stage. © 2022, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

abstract={Museums are of special nature because of their dynamic environment and different audiences. These unique characteristics make evacuation process in cases of fire incidents and similar threats difficult to assess or predict. That is due to the interaction between artifacts and museum visitors who might be from different backgrounds. The visits themselves could also be dynamic, multivariable with sensitive experience. This paper presents an Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) framework that simulates the visitation and evacuation inside museums. The proposed framework enhances visitation management and assesses evacuation efficiency in museums during fire incidents or threats. Human characteristics of occupants such as age, gender, physical ability and familiarity to the surroundings are considered in the proposed ABS. The proposed framework analyses the proximity among occupants during visitations and simulates the decision-making process during evacuation. A meta-heuristic supervised machine learning approach is used by deploying fuzzy classification method to determine the relative weights of criteria that might affect the performance of visitation and evacuation. A case study for Tutankhamun gallery in the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) is used to illustrate the practicality of the proposed model. The results from the case study shows that an average of 18 min is required for safe evacuation including pre-evacuation time. To examine the robustness of the proposed framework, sensitivity analysis was carried out to identify the factors that the model is most sensitive to. The number of exists and the certainty of diagnosis from occupants of the surrounding events are the factors that the model is highly sensitive to. The proposed framework can identify personal characteristics of occupants in the simulation environment, as well as social psychological dimensions that have an effect on decision-making while evacuating. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={To accelerate data-driven studies for various optimization applications in chemical engineering, a comprehensive machine learning aided multi-objective optimization and multi-criteria decision making (abbreviated as ML aided MOO-MCDM) framework is proposed in the present paper. The framework comprises a total of seven steps; firstly, study the application and its input-output datasets to identify objectives, constraints and required ML models; secondly, select ML model(s) for some or all objectives and constraints; thirdly, train the chosen ML model(s), including finding optimal hyperparameter values in each of them using an advanced/global optimization algorithm; fourthly, formulate the MOO problem for the application; fifthly, select a MOO method and develop/test the program; sixthly, solve the formulated MOO problem with the developed/tested MOO program many times and review the Pareto-optimal solutions obtained; lastly, perform MCDM using several methods and choose one Pareto-optimal solution for implementation. The proposed ML aided MOO-MCDM framework is useful for process design and operation of chemical and related processes. It is shown to be beneficial for the optimization of two complex chemical processes, which are supercritical water gasification process aiming for H2-rich syngas with lower greenhouse gas emissions, and combustion process in a power plant targeting for higher energy output and lower pollution of the environment. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The digital twin (DT) is a virtual replica of real-world buildings, processes, structures, people, and systems created and maintained to answer questions about its physical part, the physical twin (PT). In the case of the built environment, the PT is represented by smart buildings and infrastructures. Full synchronization between the DT and the PT will allow for a perpetual learning process and updating between the two twins. In this work, we introduce a novel concept of DT called risk-informed digital twin (RDT). In the DT the model predictions are developed through data-driven tools and algorithms. However, multiple sources of uncertainty during the lifecycle challenge our understanding and ability to effectively model the performance of the modeled systems. The RDT's importance lies in its integration of the methods and tools of statistics and risk analysis with machine learning. To this aim, the platform incorporates a novel framework of data-driven uncertainty quantification and risk analysis rooted in information theory. At the core of the RDT is a framework of sustainable and resilient based engineering (SRBE), introduced in this work and considered the first step toward the extension of performance-based engineering (PBE) approaches to socioecological-technical systems under uncertainty. A risk-informed multicriteria decision support tool able to incorporate social aspects is also included, and it can be used for sustainable and resilient design in the early stage, or management under uncertainty of smart buildings and infrastructure systems. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={Extracting domain knowledge is important for different purposes, including development of new systems and maintenance of existing systems in the domain. Automatically supporting this task is challenging; most existing methods assume high similarity of variants which limits reuse of the generated domain artifacts, or provide very low-level features which hinder domain structure and behavior. In this paper, we propose a holistic method for extracting domain knowledge in the form of feature models that capture mandatory, optional and variant domain behaviors. Particularly, the method gets low-level implementations, applies polymorphism-inspired mechanisms and multi-criteria decision making for generating candidate domain behaviors, utilizes machine learning techniques to classify local, global and irrelevant domain behaviors, and finally analyzes dependencies and presents the outcomes in the form of feature models. The approach is evaluated on two datasets: one of open-source video games, named apo-games, following a clone-and-own scenario; and the other on variants of a monopoly game, simulating a scenario of independent development of similarly behaving components. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The increasing environmental problems due to various organic micropollutants in water cause the search of suitable additional water treatment methods. Gaining experimental data for the large amount and variety of pollutants would consume a lot of time as well as economic and ecologic resources. An alternative approach is predictive quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling, which establishes a correlation between the structural properties of a molecules with a biological, physical, or chemical property. Therefore, in this study, QSPR modeling has been conducted using extensive validation techniques and statistical test to investigate the structural influence on the degradability of organic micropollutants with ozonation. In contrast to most of the other studies, the underlying dataset - rate constants for 92 organic molecules - were obtained under standardized conditions with defined experimental parameters. QSPR modeling was executed using a combination of the software PaDEL for descriptor calculation and QSARINS for the modeling process respecting all five OECD-requirements for applicable QSAR/QSPR-models. The final model was selected using a multi-criteria decision-making tool to evaluate the model quality based on all calculated statistical quality parameters. The model included 10 selected descriptors and fingerprints and showed good regression abilities, predictive power, and stability (R² = 0.8221, CCCtr = 0.9024, Q²loo = 0.7436, R²ext = 0.8420, Q²F1 = 0.8104). The applicability domain of the QSPR model was defined and an interpretation of selected model descriptors has been connected to previous experimental studies. A significant influence of the interpretable descriptors was put into experimental context and compared with previous studies and models. For example, the molar refractivity as a measure of size and polarizability of a molecule and the occurrence of important substructures such as a formamide group seem to decrease the removal rate constant. The contribution of lone electrons entering into resonance as well as the occurrence of fused rings were identified as influences for the increase of the degradability of micropollutants by ozonation. © 2022 The Author(s)},

abstract={In this paper, one multidisciplinary-applicable aggregated model has been proposed and verified. This model uses traditional techniques, on the one hand, and algorithms of machine learning as modern techniques, on the other hand, throughout the determination process of the relevance of model attributes for solving any problems of multicriteria decision. The main goal of this model is to take advantage of both approaches and lead to better results than when the techniques are used alone. In addition, the proposed model uses feature selection methodology to reduce the number of attributes, thus increasing the accuracy of the model. We have used the traditional method of regression analysis combined with the well-known mathematical method Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). This approach has been combined with the application of the ReliefF classificatory modern ranking method of machine learning. Last but not least, the decision tree classifier J48 has been used for aggregation purposes. Information on grades of the first-year graduate students at the Criminalistics and Police University, Belgrade, after they chose and finished one of the three possible study modules, was used for the evaluation of the proposed model. To the best knowledge of the authors, this work is the first work when considering mining closed frequent trees in case of the streaming of time-varying data. © 2022 by the authors.

The main purpose of the present study is related to designing and implementation of real-time monitoring, prediction, and control system for flood disaster management as a DSS. Likewise, the problem of statement in the research is correlated to implementation of a system for different climates of Iran as a unique flood control system. For the first time, this study coupled hydrological data mining, Machine Learning (ML), and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) as smart alarm and prevention systems. Likewise, it created the platform for conditional management of floods in Iran's different clusters of climates. According to the KMeans clustering system, which determines homogeneity of the hydrology of a specific region, Iran's rainfall is heterogeneous with 0.61 score, which is approved high efficiency of clustering in a vast country such as Iran with four seasons and different climates. In contrast, the relation of rainfall and flood disaster is evaluated by Nearest Neighbors Classification (NNC), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Gaussian Process Classifier (GPC), and Neural Network (NN) algorithms which have an acceptable correlation coefficient with a mean of 0.7. The machine learning outputs demonstrated that based on valid data existence problems in developing countries, just with verified precipitation records, the flood disaster can be estimated with high efficiency. In the following, Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method as a Game Theory (GT) technique ranked the preventive flood damages strategies through three social (Se 1), environmental (Se 2), and economic (Se 3) crises scenarios. The solutions of flood disaster management are collected from literature review, and the opinion approves them of 9 senior experts who are retired from a high level of water resource management positions of Iran. The outcomes of the TOPSIS method proved that National announcement for public-institutional participation for rapid response and funding (G1-2), Establishment of delay structures to increase flood focus time to give the animals in the ecosystem the opportunity to escape to the upstream points and to preserve the habitat (G 2–8), and Granting free national financial resources by government agencies in order to rebuild sensitive infrastructure such as railways, hospitals, schools, etc. to the provincial treasury (G3-10) are selected as the best solution of flood management in Social, Environmental, and Economic crises, respectively. Finally, the collected data are categorized in Social, Environmental, and Economic aspects as three dimensions of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and ranked based on the opinion of 32 experts in the five provinces of present case studies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={On average, breast cancer kills one woman per minute. However, there are more reasons for optimism than ever before. When diagnosed early, patients with breast cancer have a better chance of survival. This study aims to employ a novel approach that combines artificial intelligence and a multi-criteria decision-making method for a more robust evaluation of machine learning models. The proposed machine learning techniques comprise various supervised learning algorithms, while the multi-criteria decision-making technique implemented includes the Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations. The Support Vector Machine, having achieved a net outranking flow of 0.1022, is ranked as the most favorable model for the early detection of breast cancer. The net outranking flow is the balance between the positive and negative outranking flows. This indicates that the higher the net flow, the better the alternative. K-nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and random forest classifier ranked second, third, and fourth, with net flows of 0.0316, −0.0032, and −0.0541, respectively. The least preferred alternative is the naive Bayes classifier with a net flow of −0.0766. The results obtained in this study indicate the use of the proposed method in making a desirable decision when selecting the most appropriate machine learning model. This gives the decision-maker the option of introducing new criteria into the decision-making process. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The present study was done in order to simulate the flash-flood susceptibility across the Suha river basin in Romania using a number of 3 hybrid models and fuzzy-AHP multicriteria decision-making analysis. It should be noted that flash-flood events are triggered by heavy rainfall in small river catchments. To achieve the proposed results, a total of 8 flash-flood predictors (slope angle, plan curvature, hydrological soil groups, land use, convergence index, profile curvature, topographic position index, aspect) along with a sample of 111 torrential phenomena points were used as input datasets in the next four algorithms: Fuzzy-Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP), Deep Learning Neural Network -Analytical Hierarchy Process (DLNN-AHP), Multilayer Perceptron - Analytical Hierarchy Process (MLP-AHP) and Naïve Bayes - Analytical Hierarchy Process (NB-AHP). The Analytical Hierarchy Process was used to calculate the coefficients for each class/category of flash-flood predictors. The torrential points sample was split into training (70%) and validating samples (30%). The modelling was done in Excel, SPSS and R software (H2O package), while the result mapping was performed in ArcGIS 10.5 software. The analysis revealed that the high and very high susceptibility degrees are spread over a maximum of 35.01% of the study area. The best performances, demonstrated by an AUC-ROC of 0.984, are associated with the Deep Learning Neural Network – Analytical Hierarchy Process model, followed by Naïve Bayes – Analytical Hierarchy Process model (AUC = 0.976), Multilayer Perceptron - Analytical Hierarchy Process model (AUC = 0.882) and Fuzzy-Analytical Hierarchy Process (AUC = 0.807). These results indicates that Deep Learning Neural Network is a promising machine learning model which can provide outcomes with very high precision. Also, according to the present research results the deep learning neural network, having many hidden layers, is able outperform the multilayer perceptron that contains a single hidden layer. The main novelty of the present research is the application of the three ensemble models (DLNN-AHP, MLP-AHP and NB-AHP) and also the use of H2O package for the first time in literature, to evaluate the flash-flood susceptibility in small river catchments. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This research aims to analyze the performance of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for classifying COVID-19 from cough sounds and to identify the model(s) that consistently perform well across different cough datasets. Different performance evaluation metrics (precision, sensitivity, specificity, AUC, accuracy, etc.) make selecting the best performance model difficult. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an ensemble-based multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method for selecting top performance machine learning technique(s) for COVID-19 cough classification. We use four cough datasets, namely Cambridge, Coswara, Virufy, and NoCoCoDa to verify the proposed method. At first, our proposed method uses the audio features of cough samples and then applies machine learning (ML) techniques to classify them as COVID-19 or non-COVID-19. Then, we consider a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method that combines ensemble technologies (i.e., soft and hard) to select the best model. In MCDM, we use the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) for ranking purposes, while entropy is applied to calculate evaluation criteria weights. In addition, we apply the feature reduction process through recursive feature elimination with cross-validation under different estimators. The results of our empirical evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art models. We see that when the proposed method is used for analysis using the Extra-Trees classifier, it has achieved promising results (AUC: 0.95, Precision: 1, Recall: 0.97). © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Healthcare is considered one basic necessity to sustaining life; thereby, assessing the character of a healthy and resilient supply chain can help a nation develop ideas to combat the healthcare crisis. COVID-19 has led to a long-term strain on the healthcare supply chain (HCSC) and has resulted in a lack of basic healthcare necessities. It has become apparent that supply chain disruptions and increased usage has led to a lack of medical supplies needed to provide the proper care to patients. Multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) will help to indicate what characteristics contribute to resilient healthcare supply chains. To assess the characteristic of a resilient supply chain, significant healthcare supply chains will help indicate significant characteristics. A case study on the medical supplies’ supply chains is presented. A rank reversal proximity index MCDM method ranks criteria to assist with decision making. The proximity index will reduce the chances of the rank reversal phenomenon that results in incorrect rankings from occurring. Results show that redundancy, collaboration, and robustness are key indicators of a resilient supply chain while, supply chain design, communication capabilities, and supply chain risk management become comparatively less important during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, an unsupervised machine learning tecnique named “cluster analysis” is conducted to group the resilience indicators of the respective supply chain. Through this study, the best way to combat disruptions in the healthcare supply chain due to large-scale pandemics is to share information quickly, reduce reliance on the design of the supply chain, and track the usage of necessary medical supplies. Alternatively, we validated our study by comparing a Preference Selection Index (PSI) to the proposed method. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Similarity measure (SM) formulas are very useful tool for Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems, machine learning, medical diagnosis, psychology, etc. In this paper, some SM methods are introduced under single-valued type-2 neutrosophic (SVT2N) information, based on the Dice and Jaccard vector measures. Also, Cosine and weighted Cosine SMs between two SVT2N sets are defined for SVT2NSs. Then, motivated by the idea of vector measures, Hybrid SM and weighted Hybrid SM are developed by combining Dice and Cosine SMs. After then, a decision-making method is put forward based on technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method. Immediately after, a real example is given to indicate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed measures. In here, Hybrid SMs are discussed for different values of λ and compared with the Hybrid SMs and weighted Hybrid SMs in their own. Furthermore, a comparative analysis is made based on the TOPSIS among the vector measures, distance measures and Hybrid SMs and the agreement between the results with other measures shows that the Hybrid SM is strong and essential to minimize error margin for decision makers. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Web services are globally utilized by clients to accomplish the required functionality over the web. As a result of its popularity and flexibility in usage, thousands of functionally similar web services are available over the network. Hence, it becomes necessary to select the optimal web service to satisfy the clients' need. Various methodologies like machine learning, genetic algorithm, bio-inspired techniques, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods and many others aid in the process of selecting the best web service from thousands of alternatives. This paper aims in proposing a relatively new MCDM approach to solve the selection issue and thereby proposes a novel framework incorporating the proposed MCDM method to aid in the process of service selection. Reference ideal method (RIM) is a state-of-the-art MCDM technique to select the optimal web service based on user inputs. In spite of its popularity, this method is found to have multiple pitfalls which make the selection process less effective. This paper proposes a novel MCDM methodology named improved RIM (I-RIM) to overcome the existing pitfalls in RIM. The paper also proposes a novel framework which combines the power of graphics processing unit (GPU) and I-RIM to enhance the efficiency of the selection process. The proposed I-RIM when parallelized using GPU is found to outperform the parallelized MCDM techniques taken for study. The results also imply that the I-RIM is more consistent and stable towards the ranking process. It is also evident that the proposed framework which incorporates I-RIM outperforms RIM in terms of execution time, mean reciprocal rank and Spearman's correlation coefficient which makes the framework more stable and reliable, thus, making it suitable for real-time web service selection. © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Disposal of waste without treatment is the least preferable way of sustainable solid waste management (SWM). But most cities in developing nations still use open dumps, causing negative impacts on the environment and human health. This study offered a novel approach for selecting landfill sites and sustainable SWM in Aligarh city, India. This was done through data collection, selecting models for criterion weighting, and validation. In order to prepare a landfill site suitability map, a geographic information system (GIS)–based ensemble fuzzy analytic hierarchy process-support vector machine (FAHP-SVM) and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process-random forest (FAHP-RF) models were implemented. Considering the previous studies and the study area characteristics, eighteen thematic layers were selected. The result revealed that land value; distance from residential roads, hospitals and clinics, and waste bins; and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) have a fuzzy weight greater than 0.10, indicating significant factors. In contrast, land elevation, land slope, surface temperature, soil moisture index, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and urban classification have a zero fuzzy weight, indicating these criteria have no importance. The result further revealed that FAHP-RF with an area under curve (AUC) value of 0.91 is the more accurate model than FAHP-SVM. According to the final weight-based overlay result, seven potential landfill sites were identified, out of which three were determined as most suitable by considering current land cover, public opinions, and environmental and economic concerns. This research proposed a zonal division model based on landfill sites location for sustainable SWM in Aligarh city. However, the findings may provide a guideline to the decision-makers and planners for optimal landfill site selection in other cities of developing countries. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is an important machine learning tool used in medical data classification for disease diagnosis. The learning algorithm in ANN training plays a crucial role in classification performance. Various approaches have been successfully applied as a learning algorithm for ANN training. This paper performs an experimental study that investigates the performance of different metaheuristics as learning algorithms to train the ANN for medical data classification tasks. The experiments are carried out on 15 well-known medical datasets. A comparative study is conducted with the classical Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) and other thirteen recent and relevant metaheuristics. Different evaluation criteria such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, Geometric Mean, F-Measure, false-positive rate (FPR) are considered for performance estimation. The classification results are analyzed using Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method, and the results with analysis establish that the Equilibrium Optimizer algorithm outperforms all the other algorithms included in the comparative study. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This study focuses on suitable site identification for constructing a hospital in Malacca, Malaysia. Using significant environmental, topographic, and geodemographic factors, the study evaluated and compared machine learning (ML) and multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) for hospital site suitability mapping to discover the highest influential factors that minimize the error ratio and maximize the effectiveness of the suitability investigation. Identification of the most significant conditioning parameters that impact the choice of an appropriate hospital site was accomplished using correlation-based feature selection (CFS) with a search algorithm (greedy stepwise). To model the potential hospital site map, we utilized multilayer perceptron (MLP) and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) models. The outcome of the predicted site models was validated utilizing CFS 10-fold cross-validation, as well as ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic curve). The analysis of CFS indicated a very high correlation with R2 values of 0.99 for the MLP model. However, the ROC curve indicated a prediction accuracy of 80% for the MLP model and 83% for the AHP model. The findings revealed that the MLP model is reliable and consistent with the AHP. It is a sufficiently promising approach to the location suitability of hospitals to ensure effective planning and performance of healthcare delivery. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={In the era of social media, consumers interact and exchange information, subjective opinions, feelings or thoughts about a given issue, a product or a service, via Web 2.0 technologies. As a result, electronic Word of Mouth, eWOM, has gained increasing influence on the formation of user opinions. Therefore, extracting and analyzing eWOM statements by means of Sentiment Analysis techniques is currently a hot topic that could potentially provide companies with key information about their customers. However, among all the available techniques, choosing the most appropriate one according to the analysis criteria is a real challenge. In this contribution, we first study the main desirable criteria for a sentiment analysis approach and classify the different existing approaches based on these criteria to try and provide a solution to this issue. We then propose a Multi-criteria Decision-Making methodology that selects the most suitable technique for each business case by taking their particular criteria into account. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The catalytic dry reforming (DR) process is a clean approach to transform CO2 into H2 and CO-rich synthetic gas that can be used for various energy applications such as Fischer–Tropsch fuels production. A novel framework is proposed to determine the optimum reaction configurations and reaction pathways for DR of C1-C4 hydrocarbons via a reaction mechanism generator (RMG). With the aid of machine learning, the variation of thermodynamic and microkinetic parameters based on different reaction temperatures, pressures, CH4/CO2 ratios and catalytic surface, Pt(111), and Ni(111), were successfully elucidated. As a result, a promising multicriteria decision-making process, TOPSIS, was employed to identify the optimum reaction configuration with the trade-off between H2 yield and CO2 reduction. Notably, the optimum conditions for the DR of C1 and C2 hydrocarbons were 800°C at 3 atm on Pt(111); whereas C3 and C4 hydrocarbons found favor at 800°C and 2 atm on Ni(111) to attain the highest H2 yield and CO2 conversion. Based on the RMG-Cat (first-principle microkinetic database), the energy profile of the most selective reaction pathway network for the DR of CH4 on Pt(111) at 3 atm and 800°C was deducted. The activation energy (Ea) for C-H bond dissociation via dehydrogenation on the Pt(111) was found to be 0.60 eV, lower than that reported previously for Ni(111), Cu(111), and Co(111) surfaces. The most endothermic reaction of the CH4 reforming process was found to be C3H3* + H2O* ↔ OH* + C3H4 (218.74 kJ/mol). © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Traditional methodologies of flood monitoring are generally time-consuming and demanding tasks. In most cases, there is no possibility of flood monitoring in large areas. Due to the major drawbacks of conventional methods in flood detection of large districts, Remote Sensing (RS) has been efficiently employed as the best solution owing to its being synoptic view and cost-effective methodologies. One of the most challenging issues in RS technologies is choosing the optimal spectral bands to detect changes in the natural environment. In this research, Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTRE), as one of the most widely used Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques, was applied to select the optimal bands of Sentinel-2 satellite images for detection of flood-affected areas. For this purpose, the decision-making method was implemented during ten options and six criteria. The properties of the Sentinel-2 satellite images consisted of ten bands (with 10 and 20m spatial resolutions) and the criteria are the signal to noise ratio (SNR) related to sensor, standard deviation, variance, the SNR related to the bands, spatial resolution, and wavelength. Afterward, the ELECTRE technique was used to select six optimal bands among ten bands. The ELECTRE algorithm was programmed in MATLAB programming language that could make decisions with multiple options and multiple criteria. Furthermore, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification method, as one of the most powerful Machine Learning (ML) models, has been applied to classify the water bodies related to before and after the flood. According to the results of optimal bands classification, Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa Coefficient (KC) for the pre-flood classification were 93.65 percent and 0.923, respectively, and for the post-flood classification, the OA and KC values were 94.52 percent and 0.935 respectively. In the case of before and after flooding, the results of classification model for optimal bands had more accuracy levels in comparison with those obtained by original bands. Generally, it was found that the ELECTRE technique for selecting the best bands of Sentinel-2 satellite images and detection of flood-affected areas, in a short period of time with high accuracy, offers remarkable and consistent results. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In the context of Industry 4.0, process automation and predictive maintenance play an essential role. There is a need to provide more effective and faster maintenance through the integration of industrial tools and processes, to support manufacturing operations, in the perspective of integration standards and architectures. In a typical maintenance system, registration and maintenance requests are made through maintenance orders, which consist of a standard form and usually are created and filled manually. However, predictive maintenance requires a higher level of automatization, from data acquisition to maintenance order generation in a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) / Enterprise Asset Management (EAM). The proposal is to automate the process of generating maintenance orders, providing for automated form completion. At the physical level, assets are monitored by sensors, and, based on a set of rules, the respective predictive maintenance order will be issued in CMMS/EAS. Maintenance orders may contain variable fields according to each asset, so Machine Learning (ML) and Multicriteria Decision Making (MCDM) will be applied to fill in these fields, as well as the allocation of the maintenance orders to the maintainer that best fit for the maintenance specification. This automatic process will assist the maintenance workflow, leading to a Smart Workflow concept. A serial and parallel framework are presented, the former consists in applying TOPSIS (MCDM method) to extract features for the use in ML classification, in order to automatically fill in the appropriate form fields. The latter consists in a classification using both methods (ML and MCDM), where TOPSIS performs the initial classification, and if the alternatives ranking scores are close to each other, ML is used for more accurate classification. A case study was carried out in a Brazilian company that develops a CMMS/EAM system, distributed worldwide, and the results demonstrate that the concept of Smart Workflows is valuable, simplifying and enhancing maintenance processes. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Objective. We propose a semiautomatic pipeline for radiation therapy treatment planning, combining ideas from machine learning-automated planning and multicriteria optimization (MCO). Approach. Using knowledge extracted from historically delivered plans, prediction models for spatial dose and dose statistics are trained and furthermore systematically modified to simulate changes in tradeoff priorities, creating a set of differently biased predictions. Based on the predictions, an MCO problem is subsequently constructed using previously developed dose mimicking functions, designed in such a way that its Pareto surface spans the range of clinically acceptable yet realistically achievable plans as exactly as possible. The result is an algorithm outputting a set of Pareto optimal plans, either fluence-based or machine parameter-based, which the user can navigate between in real time to make adjustments before a final deliverable plan is created. Main results. Numerical experiments performed on a dataset of prostate cancer patients show that one may often navigate to a better plan than one produced by a single-plan-output algorithm. Significance. We demonstrate the potential of merging MCO and a data-driven workflow to automate labor-intensive parts of the treatment planning process while maintaining a certain extent of manual control for the user. © 2022 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

abstract={This paper analyzes the impact of using different types of occupancy prediction models on the performance of occupancy-based heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) control systems in residential buildings. The future occupancy prediction problem is approached from two different viewpoints: 1) as a regression task for arrival-time prediction and 2) as a classification task for occupancy-state prediction. Four machine learning techniques, namely decision trees, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), multi-layer perceptron, and gated recurrent units, are implemented to predict future occupancy from each perspective. The performance of the occupancy models is evaluated in terms of mean absolute error (MAE), accuracy, and the ability to provide occupants’ thermal comfort and to save energy. An overall performance score is proposed by making a trade-off between the energy and thermal comfort objectives using the technique for order of preference by similarity to the ideal solution method. The results demonstrate that selecting the optimal viewpoint has a higher impact on the control performance than selecting the machine learning techniques, with occupancy-state prediction models providing superior performance in most cases. It is also shown that the machine learning evaluation metrics (i.e., MAE and accuracy) provide a weak to moderate correlation with the overall performance score. Consequently, relying solely on the MAE and accuracy might fail to provide a reliable evaluation of the occupancy model performance for use in HVAC control systems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Landslide susceptibility analysis is vital for understanding precursors, associated risk, and early rescue operations. In the past, numerous attempts have been made to develop landslide susceptibility maps using various tools. This research work aims to generate landslide susceptibility maps (LSM) by developing a deep multi-layer perceptron network named as DMLP-LSM and to demonstrate it over Srinagar-Rudraprayag region, a landslide prone region recognized by the Geological Survey of India (GSI). Initially, training datasets are generated using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) enabled multi-criteria analysis, which involves information from various landslide causative factors. In a first, one dimensional line of sight (1D LOS) velocity, one of the critical inputs and prominent indicator for landslide susceptibility, is generated by processing 60 Sentinel-1A scenes using multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) algorithm. The 1D LOS velocity map, generally used for quantitative monitoring slow moving landslides, is used here as a thematic layer. The thematic layers and LSMs were fed to the proposed DMLP-LSM network as input and output, respectively. The developed model reached an accuracy of 91.47% with precision, specificity and ROC_AUC score as 92.11%, 95.55% and 0.9072, respectively. It further identified nearly 15 square km area as susceptible to landslide. The efficacy of the proposed model is compared with two well-known machine learning models for LSM preparation, namely support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). In terms of accuracy, DMLP-LSM and RF had similar performance, but better than SVM. The velocity maps derived from MT-InSAR processing played a prominent role in the generation of LSM, supporting model training and performance. The proposed model achieved highest precision and specificity, and its performance would also improve LSM preparation when using larger datasets. The obtained results are promising, and the trained model can help in the rapid generation of LSMs. © 2021 COSPAR},

abstract={In this paper, we propose to overcome the challenge of digesting opinions in a news article. Our objective is to provide a summary of opinions delivered by many sources about a main topic in an Arabic news article. In literature, several studies addressed issues related to opinion summarization. However, we noticed a lack of studies that address this problem in Arabic language. So, we have proposed two different methods: multi-criteria and machine learning-based methods. We proceed by comparing the results provided by the proposed methods for opinionated sentence extraction. The proposed methods were evaluated using two feature types: text-based features and opinion-specific features. Experimental results show the robustness of machine learning method to extract opinionated sentences with consideration of two sets of features. © 2020 The British Computer Society 2020.

abstract={Snow avalanches cause economic losses in many parts of the world, especially in mountainous areas. Due to its changing climates and the complex topography of mountainous regions in Iran, avalanches are significant problems. Therefore, modeling snow avalanches to predict them is essential for sustainable and safe development, appropriate infrastructure, planning for residential development, and loss prevention. This study assesses the performances of multi-criteria decision-making models and machine-learning hybrid models for snow avalanche susceptibility mapping in northwestern Iran's Sirvan watershed based on the weight of analytic network process, weighted linear combination, and frequency ratio. Using multicollinearity analysis and Pearson correlation, eleven snow avalanche conditioning factors were deemed appropriate for use. The areas under the curve (AUC), root mean square error (RMSE), seed cell area index, and snow avalanche relative index were used to validate snow avalanche susceptibility maps. The results showed that all hybrid models performed very well for the determination of the susceptibility of locations to avalanching. Based on the results of the validation analyses, the analytic network process-frequency ratio hybrid model was best among the models (AUC = 0.941, RMSE = 0.3). The resulting maps provide strong evidence to guide efforts to prevent the exposure to snow avalanches in the Sirvan watershed, and these hybrid models can be tested in other regions affected by snow avalanches. © 2021},

abstract={A classic example of machine learning methods is machine classification algorithms. At present, a large number of machine classification methods have been developed, which are offered in the form of ready-made software. The presence of a large number of machine classification algorithms raises the problem of choosing the best algorithm for solving a particular task. This problem is also complicated by the ambiguity with the choice of quality indicators since for the analysis of the quality of the classification there exist a number of indicators (metrics) of the classification. It is difficult for an inexperienced user to understand and choose his priorities. However, the problem of evaluating the classification algorithm's quality can be considered a problem of multicriteria decision-making. It is proposed to evaluate the algorithm's quality by means of one scalar indicator obtained by convolution of other indicators by a nonlinear scheme of compromises. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.},

abstract={Frequent modifications in the software leads to the issues in the code which deteriorates software quality. The suitable approach to rectify it is to refactor it. Consequently, this research devises a ranking using the MCDM approach for prioritizing Python-based code smells. This order ranking has been studied over 10,552 classes for five generic code smells diffused in 20 Python software. The software metrics extracted over these python classes have been considered as multiple criteria which are processed using rule-based machine learning approach. In this study, an approach providing compromised solution—VIKOR have been practiced along with TOPSIS and WASPAS methods. Additionally, the MCDM approaches have utilized Shannon’s Entropy and CRITIC method as weight estimation techniques. The extracted vital software metrics achieved over 90% accuracy. The prominent outcome portrays that the most dominant smell is Collapsible “IF” which needs to be refactored at the early stage. This should be accompanied by Cognitive Complexity smell so as to attain sustainable development environment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The COVID-19 infestation has resulted in the loss of the lives of millions of people and the destruction of commercial, communal, and healthcare systems around the world. To control these kinds of pandemics, complete knowledge of the traits and responses to the disease is required, and this knowledge can be gathered using various computational methods. These computational techniques can be very helpful in information building required for taking appropriate action timely and applying preventive mechanisms. Although there are numerous computational approaches that the researchers are applying over the past few months, there is a need to re-evaluate and compare these available techniques for finding out the best technique that can help reduce the extent of COVID-19. Hence, in this paper, we carried out a literature review to emphasize the assistance of various computational approaches around COVID-19. The paper presents a categorization of approaches such as multicriteria decision-making, fuzzy AHP, machine learning, neural network, and data science that have been used to deal with the epidemic. Furthermore, this study discusses various challenges experienced when accessing the COVID-19 data. The conclusions of the paper propose the best computational approach among all to be appraised for future investigations and implementations. © 2022 Amandeep Kaur et al.},

abstract={The training phase is the most crucial stage during the machine learning process. In the case of labeled data and supervised learning, machine learning entails minimizing the loss function under various constraints. We provide an innovative model for learning with numerous data sets, resulting from the application of multicriteria optimization techniques to existing deep learning algorithms. Data fitting is formulated as a multicriteria model in which each criterion measures the data fitting error on a specific data set. This is an optimization model involving a vector-valued function, and it has to be analyzed using the notion of Pareto efficiency. We present stability results for efficient solutions in the presence of input and output data perturbations. The multiple data set environment comes into play to eliminate the bias caused by the selection of a specific training set. To apply this concept, we present a scalarization strategy as well as numerical experiments in digit classification using MNIST data. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={To date, for the purpose of solving the complex problems in the area of expert system, Multi criteria decision making is the best technique to offer the suitable solution. In the academic literature, the MCDM methods suffered from many challenges. The most important challenges are uncertainty and vagueness. One of the latest MCDM method, called the fuzzy decision by opinion score method (FDOSM). However, there are still some vagueness issues around these methods (mention some of them). According to the advantage of the Fermatean fuzzy set in solving these issues, in this research extends FDOSM into Fermatean-FDOSM so as to effectively benchmark the real-life problem. In this study, we present our methodology in two phases. The first phase presents the mathematical model of Fermatean-FDOSM which is composed of three stages of FDOSM. The second phase applied the new extension to benchmark the COVID-19 machine learning methods. The finding of Fermatean-FDOSM after comparing the result with the basic FDSOM and TOPSIS, is more logical and undergoing a systematic ranking. In the validation process, objective validation is applied to validate the final result of Fermatean-FDOSM. The result of Fermatean-FDOSM is valid, and more logical and in line with decision makers' opinions. © 2022 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The primary objective of this study was to develop a novel data-driven machine learning-based multiobjective robust optimisation strategy to improve the overall quality of multivariate manufacturing processes. The new strategy was conceptualised considering a manufacturing environment with unreplicated non-normal data observations and limited opportunity for off-line sequential design of experiments. At a macro level, the new strategy adopts suitable artificial intelligence-based process models and a fine-tuned non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) to derive robust efficient process setting conditions. These robust solutions are iteratively derived considering process model predictive uncertainties, process setting sensitivities, and variance-covariance structure of uncontrollable multivariate non-normal inputs (or covariates). These solutions are also ranked based on multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques to facilitate implementation. In this study, the quality of the best-ranked solutions was compared (w.r.t. closeness to specified multiple targets and predicted multivariate output variabilities) with those of the solutions obtained from parametric and commercial software-based approaches using three different real-life manufacturing cases. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

This radical change is led by the belief that a connected world will perform better in decision-making and management due to the continuous updates of information. However, this big move towards computerization is based solely on engineering processes and mathematical modelling, leaving behind the human based inputs. The automation of the industrial process and decision making proved its efficiency when dealing with problems based on pure quantitative criteria. However, the human factors and in decision making are essential to evaluate the qualitative criteria. Predominantly, industrial decision making is always related to the satisfaction of the customer and the quality of developed products. These characteristics are vastly based on emotional maturity and psychological preferences, thus the importance of the evaluation of the emotional intelligence of the decision maker to ensure his or her ability to provide an optimal input during the decision process. Therefore, we focus in this study on the analysis of the impact of emotional intelligence on multicriteria decision making. A detailed presentation of the different tools of testing and assessment is provided. A proposal of an automated application to measure the emotional intelligence of the decision makers is discussed for future implementation using domain-specific languages. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Machine learning has brought data-driven methods for equipment health monitoring and prognostics to a new level. In fact, the weak cross-domain generalizability and 'Black-box' nature remain unsolved. Hence, we propose a novel framework, multiobjective evolution enhanced collaborative health monitoring and prognostics (MEeCHMPs), in which multiple relevant objectives are optimized via evolutionary approaches to construct health indicators for monitoring and prognosis of equipment health conditions. Specifically, we quantify prior degradation knowledge and domain discrepancy into an unsupervised multicriteria decision-making problem and combine various degradation features so that the Pareto dominance should be maintained. Furthermore, the explainable prognostics model is developed to solve a supervised multicriteria decision-making problem leading to symbolic life expressions, which are accurate and interpretable. Finally, MEeCHMP is applied to bearing life testes involving three-axis acceleration signals to demonstrate its performance in a real case. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Efficient evaluation for machine learning (ML)-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) for federated learning (FL) in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMTs) environment falls under the standardisation and multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. Thus, this study is developing an MCDM framework for standardising and benchmarking the ML-based IDSs used in the FL architecture of IoMT applications. In the methodology, firstly, the evaluation criteria of ML-based IDSs are standardised using the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM). Secondly, the evaluation decision matrix (DM) is formulated based on the intersection of standardised evaluation criteria and a list of ML-based IDSs. Such formulation is achieved using a dataset with 125,973 records, and each record comprises 41 features. Thirdly, the integration of MCDM methods is formulated to determine the importance weights of the main and sub standardised security and performance criteria, followed by benchmarking and selecting the optimal ML-based IDSs. In this phase, the Borda voting method is used to unify the different ranks and perform a group benchmarking context. The following results are confirmed. (1) Using FDM, 17 out of 20 evaluation criteria (14 for security and 3 for performance) reach the consensus of experts. (2) The area under curve criterion has the lowest set of weights, whilst the CPU time criterion has the highest one. (3) VIKOR group ranking shows that the BayesNet is a best classifier, whilst SVM is the last choice. For evaluation, three assessments, namely, systematic ranking, computational cost and comparative analysis, are used. IEEE},

abstract={Deep Learning methods are well-known for their abilities, but their interpretability keeps them out of high-stakes situations. This difficulty is addressed by recent model-agnostic methods that provide explanations after the training process. As a result, the current guidelines’ requirement for “interpretability from the start” is not met. As a result, such methods are only useful as a sanity check after the model has been trained. In an abstract scenario, “interpretability from the start” implies imposing a set of soft constraints on the model’s behavior by infusing knowledge and eliminating any biases. By inserting knowledge into the objective function, we present a Multicriteria technique that allows us to control the feature effects on the model’s output. To accommodate for more complex effects and local lack of information, we enhance the method by integrating particular knowledge functions. As a result, a Deep Learning training process that is both interpretable and compliant with modern legislation has been developed. Our technique develops performant yet robust models capable of overcoming biases resulting from data scarcity, according to a practical empirical example based on credit risk. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Geothermal prospectivity mapping using multiple-criteria decision analysis is well-documented in the scientific literature. However, most previous works suffer from two drawbacks: no consideration of the geology for defining the weights of the decision criteria, and no metrics of reliability for the prospectivity prediction. In this work, we introduce a method that overcomes these drawbacks and extends on a large scale the mapping provided manually by the experts. The method is based on (i) automatic regressions of both heat flow and thermal gradient maps using a multi-model approach, (ii) introduction of geology-dependent criteria weights for the decision analysis, and (iii) combination of multiple decision maps to obtain a more robust prospectivity mapping and a quantification of the reliability of the prediction. Applied to geothermal data from British Columbia, the method appears to produce prospectivity maps with higher spatial resolution than conventional ones. Besides, it substantially attenuates the footprint of data acquisition and facilitates the identification of geographical zones where the prediction is the most uncertain, thus where a human subjective interpretation would have the most added value. The proposed workflow is easily transposable to any context of subsurface exploration or exploitation, for instance in the petroleum, mining, or hydrogeological industries. © 2022 2nd EAGE Digitalization Conference and Exhibition.

abstract={Cloud computing can be considered a revolutionizing invention of decay. The computing resources are externally supplied to the user with benefits of scalability, accessibility, pay-as-you-go, serverless, etc. With its ever-growing market, there is a multitude of cloud service providers (CSPs) with different offerings available to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) or users. Due to the availability of numerous CSPs with different offerings, it becomes complicated for the user to pick the right services. In the presented paper, a supervised learning-based model based on Random Forest Regressor is proposed. The proposed model has been trained for Multi Criteria Decision Making Methods (MCDM) methods such as Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), and Weighted Sum Method (WSM). The score obtained from these MCDM methods has been used to rank the services. Results show the acceptability of the proposed model in the cloud environment. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Assessment of the thermal bioclimatic environmental changes is important to understand ongoing climate change implications on agriculture, ecology, and human health. This is particularly important for the climatologically diverse transboundary Amy Darya River basin, a major source of water and livelihood for millions in Central Asia. However, the absence of longer period observed temperature data is a major obstacle for such analysis. This study employed a novel approach by integrating compromise programming and multicriteria group decision–making methods to evaluate the efficiency of four global gridded temperature datasets based on observation data at 44 stations. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by comparing the results obtained using symmetrical uncertainty, a machine learning similarity assessment method. The most reliable gridded data was used to assess the spatial distribution of global warming-induced unidirectional trends in thermal bioclimatic indicators (TBI) using a modified Mann–Kendall test. Ranking of the products revealed Climate Prediction Center (CPC) temperature as most efficient in reconstruction observed temperature, followed by TerraClimate and Climate Research Unit. The ranking of the product was consistent with that obtained using SU. Assessment of TBI trends using CPC data revealed an increase in the Tmin in the coldest month over the whole basin at a rate of 0.03–0.08 °C per decade, except in the east. Besides, an increase in diurnal temperature range and isothermally increased in the east up to 0.2 °C and 0.6% per decade, respectively. The results revealed negative implications of thermal bioclimatic change on water, ecology, and public health in the eastern mountainous region and positive impacts on vegetation in the west and northwest. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Recently, Internet of Things (IoT) technology has emerged in many aspects of life, such as transportation, healthcare, and even education. IoT technology incorporates several tasks to achieve the goals for which it was developed through smart services. These services are intelligent activities that allow devices to interact with the physical world to provide suitable services to users anytime and anywhere. However, the remarkable advancement of this technology has increased the number and the mechanisms of attacks. Attackers often take advantage of the IoTs’ heterogeneity to cause trust problems and manipulate the behavior to delude devices’ reliability and the service provided through it. Consequently, trust is one of the security challenges that threatens IoT smart services. Trust management techniques have been widely used to identify untrusted behavior and isolate untrusted objects over the past few years. However, these techniques still have many limitations like ineffectiveness when dealing with a large amount of data and continuously changing behaviors. Therefore, this paper proposes a model for trust management in IoT devices and services based on the simple multi-attribute rating technique (SMART) and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm. The SMART is used for calculating the trust value, while LSTM is used for identifying changes in the behavior based on the trust threshold. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated using accuracy, loss rate, precision, recall, and F-measure on different data samples with different sizes. Comparisons with existing deep learning and machine learning models show superior performance with a different number of iterations. With 100 iterations, the proposed model achieved 99.87% and 99.76% of accuracy and F-measure, respectively. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Companies started to determine their strategies based on intelligent data analysis due to stagey enhance data production. Literature reviews show that the number of resources where demand estimation, location analysis, and decision-making technique applied together with the machine learning method is low in all sectors and almost none in the shopping mall domain. Within this study's scope, a new hybrid fuzzy prediction method has been developed that will estimate the customer numbers for shopping malls. This new methodology is applied to predict the number of visitors of three shopping malls on the Anatolian side of Istanbul. The forecasting study for corresponding shopping malls is made by using the daily signaling data from indoor base stations of large-scale technology and telecommunications services provider and the features to be used in machine learning models is determined by fuzzy multi criteria decision making method. Output revealed by the application of the fuzzy multi criteria decision making method enables the prioritization of features. © 2022 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The thermochemical processes such as gasification and co-gasification of biomass and coal are promising route for producing hydrogen-rich syngas. However, the process is characterized with complex reactions that pose a tremendous challenge in terms of controlling the process variables. This challenge can be overcome using appropriate machine learning algorithm to model the nonlinear complex relationship between the predictors and the targeted response. Hence, this study aimed to employ various machine learning algorithms such as regression models, support vector machine regression (SVM), gaussian processing regression (GPR), and artificial neural networks (ANN) for modeling hydrogen-rich syngas production by gasification and co-gasification of biomass and coal. A total of 12 machine learning algorithms which comprises the regression models, SVM, GPR, and ANN were configured, trained using 124 datasets. The performances of the algorithms were evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). In all cases, the ANN algorithms offer superior performances and displayed robust predictions of the hydrogen-rich syngas from the co-gasification processes. The R2 of both the Levenberg-Marquardt- and Bayesian Regularization-trained ANN obtained from the prediction of the hydrogen-rich syngas was found to be within 0.857–0.998 with low prediction errors. The sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of the process parameters on the model output revealed that all the parameters showed a varying level of influence. In most of the processes, the gasification temperature was found to have the most significant influence on the model output. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Municipal solid waste is typically managed in developing countries through various disposal methods, such as sanitary landfills or dumpsites. Alternatively, waste to energy (WTE) systems have been recently adopted to provide sustainable waste management and diversify the energy mix. The abundance of remotely sensed datasets and derivatives, along with the rapid development of artificial intelligence, can offer an effective solution for WTE site selection. In this study, an analytical hierarchy process (AHP)-based framework supported by multiple machine learning algorithms (gradient boosted tree (GBT), decision tree (DT), and support vector machines (SVMs)) was established to explore the optimum location for WTE facilities. Various social, legal, environmental, economic, morphological, and land cover parameters were considered under 11 thematic geospatial raster layers. The proposed framework was applied to the 1.5-million-capita city of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. A novel approach was developed to incorporate Gaussian dispersion modeling for the expected air pollution emissions from a WTE facility. The results showed that the accuracy performance sequence of the algorithms was 94.6, 93.9, and 91.8% for GBT, DT, and SVM, respectively. It was found that the distance from existing landfills had the most critical impact on the optimum location of the WTE facility, followed by the distance from coastline and elevation. The AHP consistency check revealed an acceptable overall criteria consistency index and the ratio of 0.0344 and 0.019, respectively. The results showed that 16.6% of Sharjah was considered extremely highly suitable areas. This research supports decision-makers in developing local guidelines for siting WTE facilities and determining the most suitable locations for such projects. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Modelling infectious diseases is a complex and multi-disciplinary problem that necessitates the combined use of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) and machine learning (ML) in a spatial framework. This research attempts to demonstrate the extensive applications of MCDA in the field of public health and to illustrate its utility with the combined use of spatial models and machine learning. The study investigates the risk factors for communicable diseases with a focus on vector-borne infectious diseases, such as West Nile Virus (WNV), malaria, dengue, etc. It aims to quantify vector-borne disease risk by examining the geographic contextual effects of socio-economic, climatic, and environmental factors using the objective-weighting technique adopted from MCDA and machine learning in a geographic information systems (GIS) framework. The authors attempted to minimize subjective bias from the decision space by utilizing an objective-weighted technique to quantify the risk. The study adopted Shannon's entropy to derive weights for each factor and its classes. The derived weighted layers are fed to an artificial neural network to obtain a final map of risk susceptibility. This final risk map allows policymakers to examine vulnerable areas and identify the factors pivotal to the contribution of risk. Findings show the traffic volume as the most influential variable, and terrain slope as the least one in the disease spread for the study area. The risk appears to be concentrated and distributed along vegetation, wetlands, and around water bodies. The results produced by ensemble learning show great promise with more than 94% accuracy. The accuracy of the results was determined by the confusion matrix and the kappa index of agreement (KIA). The vector control programmes need to adapt to better manage the dynamic changes in patterns involving vector-borne infectious diseases. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Sustainable tourism is an emerging trend around the world. Eco-friendly (green) hotels are environmentally friendly properties that are becoming more popular among green travellers. Electronic Word-of-Mouth (e-WOM) is a method of communicating with customers to share their experiences and is a powerful marketing tool for hotel marketing. This paper investigates the role of online reviews of eco-friendly hotels for preference learning using multi-criteria decision-making and machine learning techniques. We develop a new method using multi-criteria decision making, supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used as an unsupervised learning technique to cluster travellers’ online reviews. We use the Higher-Order Singular-Value Decomposition technique along with a similarity measure to find the most similar customers based on their preference. To predict travellers’ preference for eco-friendly hotels, we employ a neuro-fuzzy system, the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System, as a supervised learning technique. To select the most important criteria, we use the entropy-weight approach in each segment. Several experiments were performed on the collected data from the Czech Republic's eco-friendly hotels on the TripAdvisor platform. The results demonstrated that the hybrid approach is effective for customers’ segmentation, and preference learning and prediction in eco-friendly hotels. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In the era of big data, parallel Topk query processing under information retrieval has received increasing attention from both the industry and academia. This query handling allows users to retrieve the most useful data objects in a set of choices. This problem is compounded by the use of Topk in cases of multiple dimensions and extensive data analytics. In this article, we provide a novel parallel algorithm in a distributed recommender system based on the Apache Spark platform. The purpose of this approach was to implement the multicriteria decision aiding support and dominating query approach run by using matrix factorization and singular value decomposition (SVD)-based model as a sophisticated machine learning technique. Simultaneously, applying the resilient distributed datasets paradigm in cloud computing, which presents a favorable environment for big data management. Extensive experimental results in terms of accuracy, and scalability indicated the new algorithm's advantage compared to other Topk algorithms. Accordingly, our recommender system based on the conceived algorithm achieved high precision (62%-82%, depending on the data) to verify the profoundly positive effect of the use of the Spark framework and the SVD-based model while applying the commonly used evaluation metrics in the recommendation systems. © 2007-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Within the last thirty years, the range and complexity of methodologies proposed to assess maritime risk have increased significantly. Techniques such as expert judgement, incident analysis, geometric models, domain analysis and Bayesian Networks amongst many others have become dominant within both the literature and industry. On top of this, advances in machine learning algorithms and big data have opened opportunities for new methods which might overcome some limitations of conventional approaches. Yet, determining the suitability or validity of one technique over another is challenging as it requires a systematic multicriteria approach to compare the inputs, assumptions, methodologies and results of each method. Within this paper, such an approach is proposed and tested within an isolated waterway in order to justify the proposed advantages of a machine learning approach to maritime risk assessment and should serve as inspiration for future work. © 2021, Faculty of Navigation, Gdynia Maritime University.

abstract={Time series cross-validation is a technique to select forecasting models. Despite the sophistication of cross-validation over single test/training splits, traditional and independent metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), are commonly used to assess the model’s accuracy. However, what if decision-makers have different models fitting expectations to each moment of a time series? What if the precision of the forecasted values is also important? This is the case of predicting COVID-19 in Amapá, a Brazilian state in the Amazon rainforest. Due to the lack of hospital capacities, a model that promptly and precisely responds to notable ups and downs in the number of cases may be more desired than average models that only have good performances in more frequent and calm circumstances. In line with this, this paper proposes a hybridization of the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and fuzzy sets to create a similarity metric, the closeness coefficient (CC), that enables relative comparisons of forecasting models under heterogeneous fitting expectations and also considers volatility in the predictions. We present a case study using three parametric and three machine learning models commonly used to forecast COVID-19 numbers. The results indicate that the introduced fuzzy similarity metric is a more informative performance assessment metric, especially when using time series cross-validation. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Several attempts are needed to choose the most compatible production system for achieving the desired manufacturing outputs. The significant role of manufacturing strategy deployment is selecting the production system best suited for a manufacturing firm. The appropriately chosen production system (strategic process choice) facilitates a firm to produce “order winning” outputs and provides a production competence to achieve business success. This research presents a novel framework to determine the compatible production system for a manufacturing firm. An integrated three-stage Delphi-MCDM-Bayesian Network (BN) framework has been proposed. The process choice criteria (PCC) considered for deciding production systems are identified through an in-depth literature review and then validated by experts through a Delphi method in the first stage. It resulted in the determination of twenty-six PCC. In the second stage, the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) based voting analytical hierarchy process (VAHP) method is adopted to determine each criterion's relative importance for a firm. The relative weights obtained are then used as input for the machine learning (ML) technique- Bayesian network (BN) in the third stage. The BN model quantifies the selection probability of production systems. The proposed Delphi-MCDM-BN framework is demonstrated using a real-life case of a “hydraulic and pneumatic valve” manufacturing firm to select a suitable production system. The three-stage framework is a novel contribution to the literature, which can be used by researchers, practitioners, and manufacturing strategists to choose an appropriate production system for any manufacturing firm. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Arising the Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) concept in Europe, the solar district heating systems (SDHS) present a potential solution to meet the buildings sector's European energy performance directive. Nevertheless, current practices face several technological and economical barriers to ensure service quality. In this context, our work presents a sustainability analysis (technical, economic, environmental, and social) for SDHS integration in the residential sector to meet the NZEB and positive energy building goals. This paper proposes an application of a machine learning model incorporating multi-objective optimization and multi-criteria decision making to facilitate a sustainability index for the decision-making stakeholders and policymakers. The proposed analysis application is illustrated through retrofitted residential communities with building energy rating (D) at different sizes (10, 25, 50, 100, and 500 houses) located in Emmen (Netherlands) and compared to a standard decentralized heat pump. The optimization results show the ability of SDHS to provide a solar fraction up to 95% in the community of 500 houses. Furthermore, achieving a NZEB status is only approved economically from a community size of 100 houses with a life cycle cost of 41 €/m2 and a payback period of 25 years. These results align with a substantial environmental and social improvement of 78.2% and 29.7%, respectively, compared to the decentralized heat pump. Overall, this study provides policy decision making with an evaluation for positive energy communities and suggests the SDHS integration to meet the global sustainability goals. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={The q-rung orthopair sets (q-ROFSs) is an extended version of conventional orthopair fuzzy sets, such as intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) and Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFSs). The most appealing feature of q-ROFSs is that they provide a wider range of reasonable membership grades and offer decision makers (DMs) more leeway in expressing their legitimate perceptions. The q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers (q-ROFNs) play a vital role in computational intelligence, machine learning, neural network, and artificial intelligence. We develop numerous generalized aggregation operators (AOs) for information fusion of q-ROFNs to address some drawbacks of existing AOs. For this objective, we enhance the existing AOs by adding pairs of hesitation within the membership functions, and as a result, we introduce new operational rules for q-ROFNs utilizing Einstein norm operations. Based on suggested operational laws, we introduce new AOs namely “q-rung orthopair fuzzy Einstein interactive weighted geometric operator,” “q-rung orthopair fuzzy Einstein interactive ordered weighted geometric operator,” “generalized q-rung orthopair fuzzy Einstein interactive weighted geometric operator,” “generalized q-rung orthopair fuzzy Einstein interactive ordered weighted geometric operator,” and “generalized q-rung orthopair fuzzy Einstein interactive hybrid geometric operator.” Then, certain special cases of proposed AOs are explored and their some essential characteristics are described. A new multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approach is devised with the help of suggested AOs for modeling uncertainties in the real-life problems. Additionally, a practical application of proposed MCDM approach is presented. Moreover, the comparison analysis, sensitivity analysis and authenticity analysis of proposed MCDM approach with existing approaches is also presented to discuss the feasibility, authenticity, and superiority of the proposed method. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC},

abstract={This study presents the implementation of a non-parametric multiple criteria decision aiding (MCDA) model, the Multi-group Hierarchy Discrimination (M.H.DIS) model, through the application of an outranking MCDA approach, namely the PROMETHEE II, on a dataset of 114 European unlisted companies operating in the energy sector. Firstly, the M.H.DIS model has been developed following a five-fold cross validation procedure to analyze whether the model explains and replicates a two-group pre-defined classification of companies in the considered sample, provided by Bureau van Dijk's Amadeus database. Since the M.H.DIS method achieves a quite limited satisfactory accuracy in predicting the Amadeus classification in the holdout sample, the PROMETHEE II method has been performed then to provide a benchmark sorting procedure useful for comparison purposes. The analysis indicates that in terms of average accuracy, M.H.DIS model development with the PROMETHEE based classification provides consistently better results than the ones obtained with the Amadeus classification in most of combinations, which have been built with the financial variables covering the main firm's dimensions such as profitability, financial structure, liquidity and turnover. The better results of the proposed model in terms of accuracy rate are also confirmed by the comparison to the most three applied machine-learning methods. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Zero-carbon is the current buzzword triggering the minds of every people in the world. The current pandemic situation has given the world an alarm to act towards the reduction/eradication of carbon footprint. Developing countries like India are striving hard to strike a balance between sustainability and global growth. To support the nation, certain measures and their prioritization would be helpful. Motivated by this notion, in this study, a new framework is proposed with double hierarchy fuzzy information, which not only gives experts a better style to articulate preferences linguistically but also makes a rational decision with methodical support. Mayor's transport strategy, 2018 is a popular document that provides valuable information towards sustainable transport practices, and the measures considered in this study are adapted from the same. In this framework, (i) a novel attitudinal evidence-based Bayesian approach is proposed for criteria weight estimation; (ii) experts’ weights are determined by using variance approach, and (iii) Evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS) approach is extended for prioritizing zero-carbon measures. These approaches are integrated into a framework and its practicality is exemplified by considering a case example of prioritizing measures for a smart city in India. Finally, comparison with extant methods reveals the merits and shortcomings of the proposal. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Multicriteria recommender systems are widely used in all sectors of industries. Examples of recommender systems include Netflix's recommendation machine, Amazon's recommender machines, etc. They help people to take informed decisions. There are many research activities taking place in the recommender system field. In this research activity we discuss the performance of a multicriteria recommender system using different kinds of machine learning and deep learning approaches. We explain in depth about the need for a recommender system, and then discuss the history of recommender systems. We also discuss the different types of filtering techniques and phases of a multicriteria recommender system, and discuss many research activities conducted by researchers around the globe. Then, we describe in depth two machine learning classification approaches and a deep learning approach, which we have implemented in a recommender system. We also show how we have obtained our data set. A comparison table which contains the accuracy and other scores of three different approaches is illustrated, from this table we can easily determine which approach works better in the terms of accuracy, giving the correct recommendations. By following these steps, we were finally able to fulfill our goal. © 2022 Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Hybrid models to detect dementia based on Machine Learning can provide accurate diagnoses in individuals with neurological disorders and cognitive complications caused by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. This study proposes a hybrid approach, using Machine Learning algorithms associated with the multicriteria method of Verbal Decision Analysis (VDA). Dementia, which affects many HIV-infected individuals, refers to neurodevelopmental and mental disorders. Some manuals standardize the information used in the correct detection of neurological disorders with cognitive complications. Among the most common manuals used are the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition) of the American Psychiatric Association and the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10)—both published by World Health Organization (WHO). The model is designed to explore the predictive of specific data. Furthermore, a well-defined database data set improves and optimizes the diagnostic models sought in the research. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Land evaluation is imperative for its efficient use in agriculture. Therefore, this study aimed at assessing the suitability of a region in West El-Minia for cultivating some of the major crops using the geographical information system (GIS). The results focus on allocating space for cultivating sugar beet and utilizing the free period of sugar beet in other crops. This exploitation helps to maintain the quality of the land and increase its fertility by using crop rotation with integrated agricultural management. A machine learning technique was implemented using the random forest algorithm (RF) to predict soil suitability classes for sugar beet using geomorphology, terrain attribute and remote sensing data. Fifteen major crops were evaluated using a suitability multicriteria approach in GIS environment for crop rotation decisions. Soil parameters were determined (soil depth, pH, texture, CaCO3, drainage, ECe, and slope) to characterize the land units for soil suitability. Soils of the area were found to be Entisols; Typic Torrifluvents, Typic Torripsamments and Typic Torriorthents and Aridsols; Typic Haplocacids, Calcic Haplosalids and Sodic Haplocalcids. Overall, the studied area was classified into four suitability classes: high “S1”, moderate “S2”, marginal “S3”, and not suitable “N”. The area of each suitability class changed depending on the crop tested. The highest two crops that occupied S1 class were barley with 471.5 ha (representing 6.8% of the total study area) and alfalfa with 157.4 ha (2.3%). In addition, barley, sugar beet, and sorghum occupied the highest areas in S2 class with 6415.3 ha (92.5%), 6111.3 ha (88.11%) and 6111.3 ha (88.1%), respectively. Regarding the S3 class, three different crops (sesame, green pepper, and maize) were the most highly represented by 6151.8 ha (88.7%), 6126.3 ha (88.3%), and 6116.7 ha (88.2%), respectively. In the end, potato and beans occupied the highest areas in N class with 6916.9 ha (99.7%) and 6853.5 ha (98.8%), respectively. The results revealed that the integration of GIS and soil suitability system consists of an appropriate approach for the evaluation of suitable crop rotations for optimized land use planning and to prevent soil degradation. The study recommends using crop rotation, as it contributes to soil sustainability and the control of plant pests and diseases, where the succession of agricultural crops on a scientific basis aims at maintaining the balance of nutrients and fertilizers in the soil. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={An ultimate goal of placing fire detection systems in buildings and structures is to allow for the rapid detection of fire and accurate faster than real time prediction of ensuing fire behavior so that relevant information can be delivered to the appropriate stakeholders. In the near-term, development of detection systems with decreased detection time, better discrimination against nuisance and false alarms, and real-time monitoring of the fire state is a critical interim step. Building comfort and efficiency systems are increasingly incorporating a greater quantity of sensors and these sensors are installed at a greater density than any fire sensor with the exception of the sprinkler. While currently used primarily for building management purposes, the application of these, or similar types of building sensors, for rapid fire detection, fire state determination, and fire forecasting offers great potential. This paper discusses the potential benefits of the application of Hierarchical Temporal Memory algorithms for fire state determination in a continuous learning environment based on its application to a series of live fire experiments. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={This paper aims to select an algorithm for the Machine Learning (ML) classification task. For the proposed analysis, the Multi-criteria Decision Aid (MCDA) Méthode d'ELimination et de CHoix Includent les relations d'ORdre (MELCHIOR) method was applied. The experiment considered the following criteria as relevant: Accuracy, sensitivity, and processing time of the algorithms. The data used refers to the intention of buying on the Internet and the purpose is to predict whether the customer will finalize a particular purchase. Among various MCDA techniques available, MELCHIOR was chosen to support the decision-making process because this method provides the evaluation of alternatives without the need to elicit the weights of the criteria. As a result, the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree algorithm has been selected as the most suitable for the ML classification task. © 2021 The authors and IOS Press.},

abstract={Drowsiness is a risk to human lives in many occupations and activities where full awareness is essential for the safe operation of systems and vehicles, such as driving a car or flying an airplane. Although it is one of the main causes of many road accidents, there is still no reliable definition of drowsiness or a system to reliably detect it. Many researchers have observed correlations between frequency-domain features of the EEG signal and drowsiness, such as an increase in the spectral power of the theta band or a decrease in the spectral power of the beta band. In addition, features calculated as ratio indices between these frequency-domain features show further improvements in detecting drowsiness compared to frequency-domain features alone. This work aims to develop novel multichannel ratio indices that take advantage of the diversity of frequency-domain features from different brain regions. In contrast to the state-of-the-art, we use an evolutionary metaheuristic algorithm to find the nearly optimal set of features and channels from which the indices are calculated. Our results show that drowsiness is best described by the powers in delta and alpha bands. Compared to seven existing single-channel ratio indices, our two novel six-channel indices show improvements in (1) statistically significant differences observed between wakefulness and drowsiness segments, (2) precision of drowsiness detection and classification accuracy of the XGBoost algorithm and (3) model performance by saving time and memory during classification. Our work suggests that a more precise definition of drowsiness is needed, and that accurate early detection of drowsiness should be based on multichannel frequency-domain features. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Aquaculture is the fastest growing food production system, and the sector accounts for more than half of all fish consumed. Its potential as a sustainable food source has been recognised within the EU Farm to Fork strategy and by the targeting of EU Green Deal research funds. Aquafeed is the primary source of environmental cost in farmed finfish and shrimp life cycle assessments (LCA), and thus, emerging ingredients have a key role to play in increasing its sustainability. This paper proposes that the development and ‘design’ of feed compositions can be disrupted by innovative approaches that simultaneously optimise—via multicriteria analysis—ingredient selection through leveraging economic, nutritional, life cycle cost and environmental datasets. This would be supported by the ongoing collection and curation of these same resources. Further, integration of these disparate resources can enable advanced ingredient traceability. The outcome of such an approach would greatly contribute to increasingly efficient aquafeed production. © 2021 The Author(s)},

abstract={Public transport route planning is of growing interest in smart cities and especially in metropolitan areas where congestions and traffic jams are frequently recorded. The availability of multiple data sources, such as passenger load in trains or ticketing logs, provides an interesting opportunity to develop decision support tools to help passengers better plan their trips around the city and to enhance their travel experience. We present, in this paper, a multi-criteria journey planner that incorporates train load predictions as criteria. To this end, on the one hand, we enrich the proposed routes with predictive indicators of passenger flow such as the load on board the trains. These indicators are computed for each section of the itinerary using machine learning algorithms. On the other hand, we design a journey planner that incorporates the predicted load in its search criteria. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={A sentiment analysis of Arabic texts is an important task in many commercial applications such as Twitter. This study introduces a multi-criteria method to empirically assess and rank classifiers for Arabic sentiment analysis. Prominent machine learning algorithms were deployed to build classification models for Arabic sentiment analysis classifiers. Moreover, an assessment of the top five machine learning classifiers’ performances measures was discussed to rank the performance of the classifier. We integrated the top five ranking methods with evaluation metrics of machine learning classifiers such as accuracy, recall, precision, F-measure, CPU Time, classification error, and area under the curve (AUC). The method was tested using Saudi Arabic product reviews to compare five popular classifiers. Our results suggest that deep learning and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers perform best with accuracy 85.25%, 82.30%; precision 85.30, 83.87%; recall 88.41%, 83.89; F-measure 86.81, 83.87%; classification error 14.75, 17.70; and AUC 0.93, 0.90, respectively. They outperform decision trees, K-nearest neighbours (K-NN), and Naïve Bayes classifiers. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Landslide susceptibility (LSI) modeling of Darjeeling–Sikkim Himalaya is performed by integrating 28 causative factors on 28C28 combinations on Geographical Information System (GIS) following analytic hierarchy process (AHP)-based multicriteria decision protocol, logistic regression (LR)-based multivariate technique, machine learning data-driven random forest (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN) methods wherein the terrain is classified into ‘None’ (with: 0.0 &lt; LSI ≤ 0.17), ‘Low’ (with: 0.17 &lt; LSI ≤ 0.34), ‘Moderate’ (with: 0.34 &lt; LSI ≤ 0.51), ‘High’ (with: 0.51 &lt; LSI ≤ 0.68),‘Very High’ (with: 0.68 &lt; LSI ≤ 0.85) and ‘Severe’ (with: 0.85 &lt; LSI ≤ 1.00) susceptible zones as validated through standard statistical accuracy tests and direct cross-correlation analysis of all the susceptible zonation maps generated by drawing comparison with the 30% landslide inventory test data. The best integrated thematic RF-based LSI vector layer with an accuracy level of 0.871, in turn, on integration with the vulnerability components like population density, number of households, building types, building height and building density has demarketed approximately 21% of the region under ‘Very High’ to ‘Severe’ socioeconomic risk zone while about 36% area are classified under ‘Very High’ to ‘Severe’ structural risk zone as implicated by devastating landslide hazards in the region. Ground Penetrating Radar Survey has been conducted on all the slopes in the ‘Very High to Severe’ landslide susceptible zones wherein near-surface lithologic setting, presence of paleo-slopes and microstructural features like fractures/faults and poorly stratified debris flow have been imaged that provided favorable subsurface conditions for slope failure. Finite element method-based slope failure analysis for Newmark displacement estimates factor of safety (FoS) value that acts as the proxy in defining the degree of slope instability is seen to vary between 1.905 and 2.357 in the ‘Low to Moderate’ landslide susceptible zone while it ranges between 1.051 and 1.652 in the ‘High’ landslide susceptible zone and between 0.649 and 1.349 in the ‘Very High to Severe’ landslide inventory subset along the slopes under both gravity loading and seismic shaking in the terrain. The slope stability analysis puts the yield acceleration between 0.0012 and 0.11984 m/s2 and the total deformation between 0.0027 and 1.4484 m. All these parameters in the classified landslide susceptible zones in unison demonstrate how unstable are the terrain slopes in the ‘High to Severe’ landslide susceptible zones. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={This study determines the potential barriers to achieving circularity in dairy supply chains; it proposes a framework which covers big data driven solutions to deal with the suggested barriers. The main contribution of the study is to propose a framework by making ideal matching and ranking of big data solutions to barriers to circularity in dairy supply chains. This framework further offers a specific roadmap as a practical contribution while investigating companies with restricted resources. In this study the main barriers are classified as ‘economic’, ‘environmental’, ‘social and legal’, ‘technological’, ‘supply chain management’ and ‘strategic’ with twenty-seven sub-barriers. Various big data solutions such as machine learning, optimization, data mining, cloud computing, artificial neural network, statistical techniques and social network analysis have been suggested. Big data solutions are matched with circularity focused barriers to show which solutions succeed in overcoming barriers. A hybrid decision framework based on the fuzzy ANP and the fuzzy VIKOR is developed to find the weights of the barriers and to rank the big data driven solutions. The results indicate that among the main barriers, ‘economic’ was of the highest importance, followed by ‘technological’, ‘environmental’, ‘strategic’, ‘supply chain management’ then ‘social and legal barrier’ in dairy supply chains. In order to overcome circularity focused barriers, ‘optimization’ is determined to be the most important big data solution. The other solutions to overcoming proposed challenges are ‘data mining’, ‘machine learning’, ‘statistical techniques’ and ‘artificial neural network’ respectively. The suggested big data solutions will be useful for policy makers and managers to deal with potential barriers in implementing circularity in the context of dairy supply chains. © 2021},

abstract={The development of sustainable energy systems is very important to addressing the economic, environmental, and social pressures of the energy sector. Globally, buildings consume up to 40% of the world’s total energy. By 2030, it is expected to increase to 50%. Therefore, the world is facing a great challenge to overcome these problems related to global energy production. Malaysia is one of the top consumers of primary energy in Asia. In 2018, primary energy consumption for Malaysia was 3.79 quadrillion btu at an average annual rate of 4.58%. In this paper, we have carried out a detailed literature review on several previous studies of energy consumption in the world, especially in Malaysia, and how geographical information system (GIS) methods have been used for the spatial assessment of energy efficiency. Indeed, strategies of energy efficiency are essential in energy policy that could be created using various approaches used for energy savings in buildings. The findings of this review reveal that, for estimating energy consumption, exploring renewable energy sources, and investigating solar radiation, several geographic information system techniques such as multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) are mainly utilized. The result indicates that the fuzzy DS method can more reliably determine the optimal PV farm locations. The 3D models are also regarded as an effective tool for estimating solar radiation, since this method generates a 3D model exportable to software tools. In addition, GIS and 3D can contribute to several purposes, such as sunlight access to buildings in urban areas, city growth prediction models and analysis of the habitability of public places. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={The determination of cropland suitability is a major step for adapting to the increased food demands caused by population growth, climate change and environmental contamination. This study presents a novel cropland suitability assessment approach based on machine learning, which overcomes the limitations of the conventional GIS-based multicriteria analysis by increasing computational efficiency, accuracy and objectivity of the prediction. The suitability assessment method was developed and evaluated for soybean cultivation within two 50 × 50 km subsets located in the continental biogeoregion of Croatia, in the four-year period during 2017–2020. Two biophysical vegetation properties, leaf area index (LAI) and a fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), were utilized to train and test machine learning models. The data derived from a medium-resolution satellite mission PROBA-V were prime indicators of cropland suitability, having a high correlation to crop health, yield and biomass in previous studies. A variety of climate, soil, topography and vegetation covariates were used to establish a relationship with the training samples, with a total of 119 covariates being utilized per yearly suitability assessment. Random forest (RF) produced a superior prediction accuracy compared to support vector machine (SVM), having the mean overall accuracy of 76.6% to 68.1% for Subset A and 80.6% to 79.5% for Subset B. The 6.1% of the highly suitable FAO suitability class for soybean cultivation was determined on the sparsely utilized Subset A, while the intensively cultivated agricultural land produced only 1.5% of the same suitability class in Subset B. The applicability of the proposed method for other crop types adjusted by their respective vegetation periods, as well as the upgrade to high-resolution Sentinel-2 images, will be a subject of future research. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={The accurate modeling of landslide risk is essential pre-requisite for the development of reliable landslide control and mitigation strategies. However, landslide risk depends on the poorly known environmental and socio-economic factors for regional patterns of landslide occurrence probability and vulnerability, which constitute still a matter of research. Here, a hybrid model is described that couples data mining and multi-criteria decision-making methods for hazard and vulnerability mapping and presents its application to landslide risk assessment in Golestan Province, Northeastern Iran. To this end, landslide probability is mapped using three state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms—Maximum Entropy, Support Vector Machine and Genetic Algorithm for Rule Set Production—and combine the results with Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process computations of vulnerability to obtain the landslide risk map. Based on obtained results, a discussion is presented on landslide probability as a function of the main relevant human-environmental conditioning factors in Golestan Province. In particular, from the response curves of the machine learning algorithms, it can be found that the probability p of landslide occurrence decreases nearly exponentially with the distance x to the next road, fault, or river. Specifically, the results indicated that p≈ exp (- λx) where the length scale λ is about 0.0797 km−1 for road, 0.108 km−1 for fault, and 0.734 km−1 0.734 km−1 for river. Furthermore, according to the results, p follows, approximately, a lognormal function of elevation, while the equation p=p0-K(θ-θ0)2 fits well the dependence of landslide modeling on the slope-angle θ, with p0≈0.64,θ0≈25.6∘and|K|≈6.6×10-4. However, the highest predicted landslide risk levels in Golestan Province are located in the south and southwest areas surrounding Gorgan City, owing to the combined effect of dense local human occupation and strongly landslide-prone environmental conditions. Obtained results provide insights for quantitative modeling of landslide risk, as well as for priority planning in landslide risk management. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Accurate and stable prediction of global horizontal irradiation (GHI) is vital for managing energy systems, irrigation planning, and also decision making for future investment. Existing artificial intelligence (AI) models for prediction GHI generally have high performance, but suffer from instability and uncertainty, especially in different climate areas. Therefore, the aim of this study is to implement an ensemble strategy based on the Integrated Bayesian Multi-model Uncertainty Estimation Framework (IBMUEF) for simultaneous input parameters and model structure uncertainty quantification in AIs. In this study, robust prediction techniques of meta-heuristic optimization algorithms (Multiverse optimization (MVO), Sine-cosine algorithm (SCA), Salp swarm algorithm (SSA)) are hybridized with machine learning models of Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for GHI predictions. The ensemble IBMUEF combines the advantages of developed models to improve the predicting performance. Comparing results of IBMUEF against the developed individual models show the predictive skill and strength of IBMUEF for four meteorological stations in two climate areas (arid and semi-arid) located in Iran. The results of developed individual models showed that all six hybrid models (ANFIS-MVO, ANFIS-SCA, ANFIS-SSA, ELM-MVO, ELM-SCA, ELM-SSA) performed well in four stations. The ranking of models carried out by Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) method of Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS). The ANFIS-MVO model with the highest rank was selected as the best model that R2, RMSE, MAE, and NSE values were ranged from 0.9929 to 0.9989, from 16.23 to 54.78 Wh/m2/day, from 4.21 to 10.39 Wh/m2/day, and from 0.993 to 0.999, respectively. The accuracy of ensemble IBMUEF based on the average RMSE was 23.7% and 32.2% better than the ANFIS-MVO model in arid and semi-arid climates, respectively. Evaluation results related to input parameters and model structure uncertainties proved the superiority of ensemble IBMUEF over the individual models, while 95% confidence interval covered almost 96% of observation data. The results highlighted the significance of combining individual models in IBMUEF for more accurate prediction of GHI with a suitable level of uncertainty. In conclusion, simultaneous considering of model input uncertainty and model parameter uncertainty is crucial for obtaining realistic and certain GHI predictions and correct quantification of the uncertainty bounds. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper presents a case study based on the CRISP-DM Model and the use of Text Mining tools and techniques to automate the Passive Transparency process at the Brazilian Ministry of Mines and Energy. Thus, a Machine Learning Model is proposed to predict the class of the technical unit responsible for the data/information requested by citizens. Through the application of the algorithm LDA and TF-IDF it was possible to map the topics of the most relevant subjects for society. The stability of the model was tested from the comparative analysis between 5 known classification algorithms (Random Forest, Multinomial NB, Linear SVC, Logistic Regression, XGBoost and Gradient Boosting). XGBoost presented better performance and precision in multiclass learning outcomes. © 2021 ACM.},

abstract={Multiple criteria decision aiding (MCDA) is a family of analytic approaches to depicting the rationale of human decisions. To better interpret the contributions of individual attributes to the decision maker, the conventional MCDA approaches assume that the attributes are monotonic and preference independence. However, the capacity in describing the decision maker's preferences is sacrificed as a result of model simplification. To meet the decision maker's demand for more accurate and interpretable decision models, we propose a novel hybrid method, namely Neural Network-based Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (NN-MCDA), which combines MCDA model and machine learning to achieve better prediction performance while capturing the relationships between individual attributes and the prediction. NN-MCDA uses a linear component (in an additive form of a set of polynomial functions) to characterize such relationships through providing explicit non-monotonic marginal value functions, and a nonlinear component (in a standard multilayer perceptron form) to capture the implicit high-order interactions among attributes and their complex nonlinear transformations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NN-MCDA with extensive simulation studies and three real-world datasets. The study sheds light on how to improve the prediction performance of MCDA models using machine learning techniques, and how to enhance the interpretability of machine learning models using MCDA approaches. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This study aims to investigate the travellers' choice behaviour towards green hotels through existing online travel reviews on TripAdvisor. Accordingly, a method combining segmentation and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) techniques was developed to segment travellers based on their provided reviews and to prioritize green hotel attributes based on their level of importance in each segment. The data were taken from travellers' online reviews of Malaysian eco-friendly hotels on TripAdvisor. The results showed that the sleep quality was one of the most imporant factors for eco-hotel selection in the majority of segments. The developed method in this study was able to analyse travellers’ reviews and ratings on eco-friendly hotels to identify the future choice behaviour and aid travellers in their decision-making process. The study provides new insights for hotel managers and green policy makers on developing environmental-friendly practices. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This work developed models to identify optimal spatial distribution of emergency evacuation centers (EECs) such as schools, colleges, hospitals, and fire stations to improve flood emergency planning in the Sylhet region of northeastern Bangladesh. The use of location-allocation models (LAMs) for evacuation in regard to flood victims is essential to minimize disaster risk. In the first step, flood susceptibility maps were developed using machine learning models (MLMs), including: Levenberg–Marquardt back propagation (LM-BP) neural network and decision trees (DT) and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method. Performance of the MLMs and MCDM techniques were assessed considering the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. Mathematical approaches in a geographic information system (GIS) for four well-known LAM problems affecting emergency rescue time are proposed: maximal covering location problem (MCLP), the maximize attendance (MA), p-median problem (PMP), and the location set covering problem (LSCP). The results showed that existing EECs were not optimally distributed, and that some areas were not adequately served by EECs (i.e., not all demand points could be reached within a 60-min travel time). We concluded that the proposed models can be used to improve planning of the distribution of EECs, and that application of the models could contribute to reducing human casualties, property losses, and improve emergency operation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={As an alternative centralized systems, which may prevent data to be stored in a central repository due to its privacy and/or abundance, federated learning (FL) is nowadays a game changer addressing both privacy and cooperative learning. It succeeds in keeping training data on the devices, while sharing locally computed then globally aggregated models throughout several communication rounds. The selection of clients participating in FL process is currently at complete/quasi randomness. However, the heterogeneity of the client devices within Internet-of-Things environment and their limited communication and computation resources might fail to complete the training task, which may lead to many discarded learning rounds affecting the model accuracy. In this article, we propose FedMCCS, a multicriteria-based approach for client selection in FL. All of the CPU, memory, energy, and time are considered for the clients resources to predict whether they are able to perform the FL task. Particularly, in each round, the number of clients in FedMCCS is maximized to the utmost, while considering each client resources and its capability to successfully train and send the needed updates. The conducted experiments show that FedMCCS outperforms the other approaches by: 1) reducing the number of communication rounds to reach the intended accuracy; 2) maximizing the number of clients; 3) handling the least number of discarded rounds; and 4) optimizing the network traffic. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Hazards and disasters have always negative impacts on the way of life. Landslide is an overwhelming natural as well as man-made disaster that causes loss of natural resources and human properties throughout the world. The present study aimed to assess and compare the prediction efficiency of different models in landslide susceptibility in the Kysuca river basin, Slovakia. In this regard, the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory combining with the analytic network process (FDEMATEL-ANP), Naïve Bayes (NB) classifier, and random forest (RF) classifier were considered. Initially, a landslide inventory map was produced with 2000 landslide and non-landslide points by randomly divided with a ratio of 70%:30% for training and testing, respectively. The geospatial database for assessing the landslide susceptibility was generated with the help of 16 landslide conditioning factors by allowing for topographical, hydrological, lithological, and land cover factors. The ReliefF method was considered for determining the significance of selected conditioning factors and inclusion in the model building. Consequently, the landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) were generated using the FDEMATEL-ANP, Naïve Bayes (NB) classifier, and random forest (RF) classifier models. Finally, the area under curve (AUC) and different arithmetic evaluation were used for validating and comparing the results and models. The results revealed that random forest (RF) classifier is a promising and optimum model for landslide susceptibility in the study area with a very high value of area under curve (AUC = 0.954), lower value of mean absolute error (MAE = 0.1238) and root mean square error (RMSE = 0.2555), and higher value of Kappa index (K = 0.8435) and overall accuracy (OAC = 92.2%). © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={We contribute MobileVisFixer, a new method to make visualizations more mobile-friendly. Although mobile devices have become the primary means of accessing information on the web, many existing visualizations are not optimized for small screens and can lead to a frustrating user experience. Currently, practitioners and researchers have to engage in a tedious and time-consuming process to ensure that their designs scale to screens of different sizes, and existing toolkits and libraries provide little support in diagnosing and repairing issues. To address this challenge, MobileVisFixer automates a mobile-friendly visualization re-design process with a novel reinforcement learning framework. To inform the design of MobileVisFixer, we first collected and analyzed SVG-based visualizations on the web, and identified five common mobile-friendly issues. MobileVisFixer addresses four of these issues on single-view Cartesian visualizations with linear or discrete scales by a Markov Decision Process model that is both generalizable across various visualizations and fully explainable. MobileVisFixer deconstructs charts into declarative formats, and uses a greedy heuristic based on Policy Gradient methods to find solutions to this difficult, multi-criteria optimization problem in reasonable time. In addition, MobileVisFixer can be easily extended with the incorporation of optimization algorithms for data visualizations. Quantitative evaluation on two real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. © 1995-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Crop diversification, both in time and in space, is essential for agroecological pest management. Process-based weed dynamics models are valuable tools to investigate this issue. Indeed, (1) weeds are the most harmful pest in arable crops and are essential for biodiversity, and (2) the processes driving crop-weed interactions are similar to those for crop-crop interactions in crop mixtures and crop rotations. Such models (3) synthesize existing and produce emergent knowledge on agroecological levers such as crop diversification, (4) mobilize this knowledge for cropping-system design, and (5) transfer research-based knowledge to stakeholders. The present paper illustrates these five items with the FLORSYS model. Its inputs are a detailed list of cultural operations over several years (crop succession including cover crops and crop mixtures, management techniques), together with daily weather data, soil characteristics and a regional weed species pool. FLORSYS runs at a daily time step, (1) focusing on processes leading to plant emergence and establishment of crop and weed species with different ecological requirements (essential for crops sown in different seasons and in mixtures where timing often determines the fate of a species), (2) representing and modelling the functioning of heterogeneous crop-weed canopies including diverse plant ages, morphologies and shade responses (as in crop mixtures), (3) including a carry-over effect on future cropping seasons (which is essential for crop rotations), and (4) assessing weed contribution to biodiversity. Detailed biophysical model outputs allow understanding the performance of a given crop, management technique or cropping system. Together with stakeholders, detailed model outputs were aggregated into indicators of crop production as well as weed benefits and harmfulness to simplify the multicriteria comparison of cropping systems. To facilitate decision support, FLORSYS was used as a virtual farm-field network, and the resulting simulation outputs were aggregated into a faster and easier-to-use metamodel (DECIFLORSYS) using machine learning techniques. These models were used to evaluate and promote the benefits of crop diversification for agroecological weed management, by (1) identifying crop ideotypes, (2) tracking crop-diverse solutions in farm-field networks, (3) evaluating crop-diverse solutions proposed by experts and stakeholders, and (4) feeding participatory workshops with farmers. The case studies demonstrate that the benefits of crop diversification depend on the production situations and cropping systems, and thus the need for flexible rules on crop diversification and the usefulness of models such as FLORSYS to establish these rules. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Vis-NIRS, MIRS, and a combination of both coupled with PLS and machine learning were applied to i) trace the composed proportions of different apple varieties in formulated purees and ii) predict the quality characteristics of formulated purees from spectral information of initial puree cultivars. The PLS models could estimate proportions of each apple cultivar in puree mixtures using MIR spectra (RMSEP<8.1%, RPD> 3.6), especially for Granny Smith (RMSEP = 2.7%, RPD = 11.4). The concentration profiles from multivariate curve resolution-alternative least squares (MCR-ALS) made possible to reconstruct spectra of formulated purees. MIRS technique was evidenced to predict the final puree quality, such as viscosity (RPD>4.0), contents of soluble solids (RPD = 4.1), malic acid (RPD = 4.7) and glucose (RPD = 4.3), based only on the spectral data of composed puree cultivars. Infrared technique should be a powerful tool for puree traceability, even for multicriteria optimization of final products from the characteristics of composed puree cultivars before formulation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Purpose: This paper presents an algorithm that can elicitate all or any combination of parameters for the ELECTRE II, III or IV, methods. The algorithm takes some steps of a machine learning ensemble technique, the random forest, and for that, the authors named the approach as Ranking Trees Algorithm. Design/methodology/approach: First, for a given method, the authors generate a set of ELECTRE models, where each model solves a random sample of criteria and actions (alternatives). Second, for each generated model, all actions are projected in a 1D space; in general, the best actions have higher values in a 1D space than the worst ones; therefore, they can be used to guide the genetic algorithm in the final step, the optimization phase. Finally, in the optimization phase, each model has its parameters optimized. Findings: The results can be used in two different ways; the authors can merge all models, to find the elicitated parameters in this way, or the authors can ensemble the models, and the median of all ranks represents the final rank. The numerical examples achieved a Kendall Tau correlation rank over 0.85, and these results could perform as well as the results obtained by a group of specialists. Originality/value: For the first time, the elicitation of ELECTRE parameters is made by an ensemble technique composed of a set of uncorrelated multicriteria models that can generate robust solutions. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The selection of Maintenance Significant Items (MSI) is a very important phase in the implementation of Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) in any organization, being essentially a screening phase in which the number of items for analysis can be reduced and prioritized. Despite its importance, there are currently few studies that present systematic and structured methods for MSI identification. There are two phases to identify these items in a physical asset portfolio: firstly, based on the system study and analysis, the criteria and scales are established; secondly, the criteria evaluation for each item is performed. In the latter phase, generally, a Multicriteria Decision-Making (MCDM) method is used to rank the MSI. However, their intrinsic subjective evaluation can lead to bias results. To prevent this issue and simplify the process, this work proposes the use of an unsupervised method based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). With this method application, not only the MSI of a system are defined, but also the importance of the criteria selected in the first phase is assessed based on the variability of the scores associated with each item. To demonstrate the method, it is implemented considering data from a hydroelectric power plant, and the results are compared to those obtained from a more traditional approach. It is noted that the proposed method points to a robust MSI selection, consistent with the analyzed system. © ESREL 2021. Published by Research Publishing, Singapore.},

abstract={Multicriteria recommender systems are widely used in all sectors of industries. Examples of recommender systems include Netflix’s recommendation machine, Amazon’s recommender machines, etc. They help people to take informed decisions. There are many research activities taking place in the recommender system field. In this research activity we discuss the performance of a multicriteria recommender system using different kinds of machine learning and deep learning approaches. We explain in depth about the need for a recommender system, and then discuss the history of recommender systems. We also discuss the different types of filtering techniques and phases of a multicriteria recommender system, and discuss many research activities conducted by researchers around the globe. Then, we describe in depth two machine learning classification approaches and a deep learning approach, which we have implemented in a recommender system. We also show how we have obtained our data set. A comparison table which contains the accuracy and other scores of three different approaches is illustrated, from this table we can easily determine which approach works better in the terms of accuracy, giving the correct recommendations. By following these steps, we were finally able to fulfill our goal. © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper deals with making decisions in local government units in the case of evaluating the projects of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the city of Zabok. There are 18 active NOGs in the city and they send their proposals to the city and depending on the quality of the proposals, the city determines the budget size they will fund. There are 17 criteria in the process of evaluation. The process requires the participation of experts that are capable of evaluation, and the city faces certain issues regarding the experts: it is hard to find them, and there is no budget to pay them. Additionally, the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods used in the process of evaluation are complex, and the process is time-consuming. In this paper, the combined MCDM & machine learning approach is used. There are several benefits of using the proposed approach. The approach applies long-term knowledge about the applicants in the evaluation of projects which is in the line with the rules of the public call. Also, the number of experts is now decreased since the neural network contains experts0 knowledge. © 2021 Samo Drobne – Lidija Zadnik Stirn – Mirjana Kljajić Borštnar – Janez Povh – Janez Žerovnik},

abstract={With the expansion of coronavirus in the World, the search for technology solutions based on the analysis and prospecting of diseases has become constant. The paper addresses a machine learning algorithms analysis used to predict and identify infected patients. For analysis, we use a multicriteria approach using the PROMETHEE-GAIA method, providing the structuring of alternatives respective to a set of criteria, thus enabling the obtaining of their importance degree under the perspective of multiple criteria. The study approaches a sensitivity analysis, evaluating the alternatives using the PROMETHEE I and II methods, along with the GAIA plan, both implemented by the Visual PROMETHEE computational tool, exploring numerical and graphical resources. The analysis model proves to be effective, guaranteeing the ranking of alternatives by inter criterion evaluation and local results with intra criterion evaluation, providing a transparent analysis concerning the selection of prediction algorithms to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={In machine learning, the presence of a large number of explanatory features leads to a greater complexity of the algorithms and to a strong degradation in the performance of the prediction models. For this, a selection of an optimal discriminating subset is necessary. Feature selection can be viewed as a multi-objective optimization problem, since, in the simplest case, it involves feature subset size minimization and performance maximization. In our work, we introduced approaches based on the theory of preordering that use association techniques between two heterogeneous features, introduced by S.Chah, H. Chamla1 [14], and between several ones, the first approach consists in selecting at each step a variable by maximizing two criteria, eliminating the effect of the variable in question, and moving on to the next step, the procedure stops when the second criterion is no longer significant. In the second approach, we adapted SFFS (Sequential Floating Forward Selection) and SFBS (Sequential Floating Backward Selection) to our problem. These methods consist of using the SFS (Sequential Forward Selection) algorithm once so as to add 1 features, then using the SBS (Sequential Backward Selection) algorithm for r times in order to remove r features. These steps are then repeated until the stop criterion is obtained. As the optimal values of these parameters cannot be determined theoretically, we proposed to leave them floating during the selection process in order to get as close as possible to the optimal solution. The proposed approaches were tested on several datasets and the experimental results were very satisfactory. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Generating the overall assessments of cases from their observations on multiple criteria when large volumes of historical data have been accumulated is a key issue. This study, therefore, developed the framework of multi-criteria appraisal recommendation (MCAR). Five strategies belonging to three categories were designed to recommend the overall appraisals of new cases from their observations on multiple criteria based on relevant historical data. The proposed framework’s basic conditions and key issues were presented to widen its application. The framework was then used to generate the diagnostic recommendations for thyroid nodules from their observations based on the historical examination reports of six radiologists. The experimental results indicated that different strategies are appropriate for different radiologists, and no single strategy was found to be the most appropriate for all considered radiologists. The five strategies were compared with four representative machine learning models to highlight their performances and interpretabilities using the historical examination reports of the radiologists. © Operational Research Society 2022.},

abstract={The present study aims to enrich the specialized literature by proposing and calculating a new flash-flood propagation susceptibility index (FFPSI). Thus, firstly the Flash-Flood Potential Index (FFPI) using the ensembles of the next models was calculated: Weights of Evidence (WOE), Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), Logistic Regression (LR), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and Radial Basis Function Neural Network-Weights of Evidence (RBFN-WOE). A number of 255 flash-flood locations, split into training (70%) and validating (30%) samples, along with 10 predictors were used as input in the five models. The Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curve and several statistical metrics were used to evaluate the Flash-Flood Potential Index results. LR-WOE and AHP-WOE were the most performant models. Nevertheless, all the applied models performed very well (AUC > 0.85). Further, the FFPSI was determined by integrating the FFPI results into a Flow Accumulation procedure. Over 55% of the valleys identified are characterized by high and very high values of FFPSI. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={A clear understanding of the spatial distribution of earthquake events facilitates the prediction of seismicity and vulnerability among researchers in the social, physical, environmental, and demographic aspects. Generally, there are few studies on seismic risk assessment in United Arab Emirates (UAE) within the geographic information system (GIS) platform. Former researches and recent news events have demonstrated that the eastern part of the country experiences jolts of 3-5 magnitude, specifically near Fujairah city and surrounding towns. This study builds on previous research on the seismic hazard that extracted the eastern part of the UAE as the most hazard-prone zone. Therefore, this study develops an integrated analytical hierarchical process (AHP) and machine learning (ML) for risk mapping considering eight geospatial parameters-distance from shoreline, schools, hospitals, roads, residences, streams, confined area, and confined area slope. Experts' opinions and literature reviews were the basis of the AHP ranking and weighting system. To validate the AHP system, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), and random forest (RF) classifiers were applied to the datasets. The datasets were split into 60: 40 ratio for training and testing. Results show that SVM has the highest accuracy of 79.6% compared to DT and RF with a "predicted high"precision of 87.5% attained from the model. Risk maps from both AHP and ML approaches were developed and compared. Risk analysis was categorised into 5 classes "very high,""high,""moderate,""low,"and "very low."Both approaches modelled relatable spatial patterns as risk-prone zones. AHP approach concluded 3.6% as "very high"risk zone, whereas only 0.3% of total area was identified from ML. The total area for the "very high"(20 km2) and "high"(114 km2) risk was estimated from ML approach. © 2021 Diena Al-Dogom et al.},

abstract={The subject of the paper is multicriteria problems that arise when modeling the complex diversification of a centralized pharmacy network. The purpose of the work is to analyze the peculiarities of solving the three-criteria problem of pharmacy network diversification by the method of successive concessions in the MATLAB package. The paper solves the following problems: research of the advantages of the proposed three-criteria model of pharmacy network diversification in relation to the classical two-criteria model of portfolio theory; construction of the relation of dominance on a set of criteria; determination of the area of stability in the space of the parameters of the concessions method; evaluating the effectiveness of the method for problems of different sizes. The following methods are used: classical portfolio theory, multicriteria optimization, the successive concessions method, computer modeling of the Pareto set. The results obtained: a study of the processes of complex diversification of the pharmacy network by building portfolio models and solving the relevant multicriteria problems by the successive concessions method. Acceptable sets and sets of pareto-optimal portfolios for the risk management are graphically found, taking into account the activity of the network itself and the client portfolio. Conclusions: The results of computer modeling and numerical analysis of solutions by sequential concessions will be useful for automating the business processes of pharmacy networks, risk management, analysis of market data to improve their efficiency. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

abstract={Optimization of water consumption in agriculture is necessary to preserve freshwater reserves and reduce the environment’s burden. Finding optimal irrigation and water resources for crops is necessary to increase the efficiency of water usage. Many optimization approaches maximize crop yield or profit but do not consider the impact on the environment. We propose a machine learning approach based on the crop simulation model WOFOST to assess the crop yield and water use efficiency. In our research, we use weather history to evaluate various weather scenarios. The application of multi-criteria optimization based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) allows users to find the dates and volume of water for irrigation, maximizing the yield and reducing the total water consumption. In the study case, we compared the effectiveness of NSGA-II with Monte Carlo search and a real farmer’s strategy. We showed a decrease in water consumption simultaneously with increased sugar-beet yield using the NSGA-II algorithm. Our approach yielded a higher potato crop than a farmer with a similar level of water consumption. The NSGA-II algorithm received an increase in yield for potato crops, but water use efficiency remained at the farmer’s level. NSGA-II used water resources more efficiently than the Monte Carlo search and reduced water losses to the lower soil horizons. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

New technical indicators based on the support/resistance zones are introduced to enrich the set of features. We evaluate whether the performance of the LSTM network model is improved when we select features with respect to the newly proposed methods. Moreover, we employ mul-ticriteria optimization to perform adequate feature selection among the proposed approaches, with respect to precision, recall, and Fβ score. Seven variations of approaches to select features are proposed and the best is selected by incorporation of multicriteria optimization. © 2021, ComSIS Consortium. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In many real-world applications, the problem of machine learning is based on multicriteria. The multicriteria learning process becomes problematic with data classification involving multiple class labels. The multilabel-multicriteria classification (MLMCC) is an emerging research area among the data science community, and it has applications in many domains like sciences, computer vision, government, business, and engineering domains. Most of the existing classification techniques learn single criteria and fail to focus with the multicriteria-based internal information. In order to overcome the above research problem, we propose an expert-based pattern driven multilabel learning algorithms (E-PDMLAs) to handle MLMCC. The whole framework is supported with expert knowledge observed as multicriteria, and it is summarized into three broad categories of linguistic terms, namely, MoreThan(>=), LessThan(<=), and Between(-). Also, the top level of data analytics is to unfold the prescriptive analysis on the data. In this work, prescribing data is supported with linguistic terms, namely, Critical, Feasible, and Strong. In support of E-PDMLA, the data have been preprocessed and prescribed into linguistic terms for the better insight of information. In this paper, we propose a novel automated prescriptive and fuzzy-based preprocessing algorithm (prescriptive fuzzy-based domain data preprocessing technique [PF-DDPT]) for all the above three categories. The experimental study has been carried out with Indian coastal dataset, crop dataset, and breast cancer dataset, and the results have been compared with normal and modeling technique. The analysis manifests the strength of our proposed algorithm (PF-DDPT) over accuracy on preprocessing and prescription based on expert perception. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Knowledge of the spatial distribution of agricultural crops and crop rotation is necessary for the understanding of the farming practices concerning the long-term sustainability of agricultural production. Agricultural crops are increasingly subject to drought due to the effects of global climate change, and the same is true for Croatia due to the constant rise in mean annual temperatures and uneven rainfall distribution. Remote sensing methods have proven to be superior in the detection and monitoring of drought compared to conventional methods of observation from meteorological stations. Information on the condition of crops in the early stages of development indicates potential irregularities in the development of agricultural crops. The objective of this paper is to provide a perspective for the application of remote sensing in crop management using state-of-the-art methods. Analysis of the possible implementation of these methods in Croatia was performed on a macro-and micro-level. Spatial classification, cropland suitability multicriteria analysis, drought assessment, weed detection and crop density calculation were evaluated according to the necessary equipment and data processing segments. Remote sensing application in crop management offers a potential basis for better crop management both at the macro-level for land use planning and at the micro-level for family farms. © 2021, University of Zagreb - Faculty of Agriculture.

abstract={Autism Spectrum Disorder is a mental disorder that afflicts millions of people worldwide. It is estimated that one in 160 children has traces of autism, with five times the higher prevalence in boys. The protocols for detecting symptoms are diverse. However, the following are among the most used: the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5), of the American Psychiatric Association; the Revised Autistic Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-R); the Autistic Diagnostic Interview (ADI); and the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10), published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and adopted in Brazil by the Unified Health System (SUS). The application of machine learning models helps make the diagnostic process of Autism Spectrum Disorder more precise, reducing, in many cases, the number of criteria necessary for evaluation, denoting a form of attribute engineering (feature engineering) efficiency. This work proposes a hybrid approach based on machine learning algorithms' composition to discover knowledge and concepts associated with the multicriteria method of decision support based on Verbal Decision Analysis to refine the results. Therefore, the study has the general objective of evaluating how the mentioned hybrid methodology proposal can make the protocol derived from ICD-10 more efficient, providing agility to diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder by observing a minor symptom. The study database covers thousands of cases of people who, once diagnosed, obtained government assistance in Brazil. Copyright © 2021 Evandro Andrade et al.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper presents an algorithm that can elicitate (infer) all or any combination of elimination and choice expressing reality (ELECTRE) Tri-B parameters. For example, a decision maker can maintain the values for indifference, preference and veto thresholds, and the study’s algorithm can find the criteria weights, reference profiles and the lambda cutting level. The study’s approach is inspired by a machine learning ensemble technique, the random forest, and for that, the authors named the study’s approach as ELECTRE tree algorithm. Design/methodology/approach: First, the authors generate a set of ELECTRE Tri-B models, where each model solves a random sample of criteria and alternates. Each sample is made with replacement, having at least two criteria and between 10% and 25% of alternates. Each model has its parameters optimized by a genetic algorithm (GA) that can use an ordered cluster or an assignment example as a reference to the optimization. Finally, after the optimization phase, two procedures can be performed; the first one will merge all models, finding in this way the elicitated parameters and in the second procedure, each alternate is classified (voted) by each separated model, and the majority vote decides the final class. Findings: The authors have noted that concerning the voting procedure, nonlinear decision boundaries are generated and they can be suitable in analyzing problems of the same nature. In contrast, the merged model generates linear decision boundaries. Originality/value: The elicitation of ELECTRE Tri-B parameters is made by an ensemble technique that is composed of a set of multicriteria models that are engaged in generating robust solutions. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Electronic Health Records (EHRs) hold symptoms of many diverse diseases and it is imperative to build models to recognise these problems early and classify the diseases appropriately. This classification task could be presented as a single or multi-label problem. Thus, this study presents Psychotic Disorder Diseases (PDD) dataset with five labels: bipolar disorder, vascular dementia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), insomnia, and schizophrenia as a multi-label classification problem. The study also investigates the use of deep neural network and machine learning techniques such as multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and Decision tree (DT), for identifying hidden patterns in patients' data. The study furthermore investigates the symptoms associated with certain types of psychotic diseases and addresses class imbalance from a multi-label classification perspective. The performances of these models were assessed and compared based on an accuracy metric. The result obtained revealed that deep neural network gave a superior performance of 75.17% with class imbalance accuracy, while the MLP model accuracy is 58.44%. Conversely, the best performance in the machine learning techniques was exhibited by the random forest model, using the dataset without class imbalance and its result, compared with deep learning techniques, is 64.1% and 55.87%, respectively. It was also observed that patient's age is the most contributing feature to the performance of the model while divorce is the least. Likewise, the study reveals that there is a high tendency for a patient with bipolar disorder to have insomnia; these diseases are strongly correlated with an R-value of 0.98. Our concluding remark shows that applying the deep and machine learning model to PDD dataset not only offers improved clinical classification of the diseases but also provides a framework for augmenting clinical decision systems by eliminating the class imbalance and unravelling the attributes that influence PDD in patients. © 2021 The Author(s)},

abstract={The apparition of Covid19 represents a horrible disease that upset the human’s life. The difficulty of this disease is its rapid evolution through people contact. Hence, designing an efficient classifier model is mandatory. In this work, we present an effective hybrid multicriteria model for patients’ classification. Our approach is composed of two-stage: the first one consists of generating the criteria priorities using the multi-criteria Best Worst Method (BWM) tool used to estimate a set of alternatives concerning a data set of decision criteria, while the second is based on making the patient classification using the Support Vector Machines (SVM), are controlled learning models with related learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification. This combination proposed to classify the patient’s diagnostic as infected by COVID or not. In this study, we considered these criteria: fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath in severe cases, and the age of the patient), Predicting the right classification rapidly will reduce the number of affected people. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Data is evolving with the rapid progress of population and communication for various types of devices such as networks, cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), actuators, and sensors. The increment of data and communication content goes with the equivalence of velocity, speed, size, and value to provide the useful and meaningful knowledge that helps to solve the future challenging tasks and latest issues. Besides, multicriteria based decision making is one of the key issues to solve for various issues related to the alternative effects in big data analysis. It tends to find a solution based on the latest machine learning techniques that include algorithms like decision making and deep learning mechanism based on multicriteria in providing insights to big data. On the other hand, the derivations are made for it to go with the approximations to increase the duality of runtime and improve the entire system's potentiality and efficacy. In essence, several fields, including business, agriculture, information technology, and computer science, use deep learning and multicriteria-based decision-making problems. This paper aims to provide various applications that involve the concepts of deep learning techniques and exploiting the multicriteria approaches for issues that are facing in big data analytics by proposing new studies with the fusion approaches of data-driven techniques. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Purpose: To predict the impact of optimization parameter changes on dosimetric plan quality criteria in multi-criteria optimized volumetric-modulated-arc therapy (VMAT) planning prior to optimization using machine learning (ML). Methods: A data base comprising a total of 21,266 VMAT treatment plans for 44 cranial and 18 spinal patient geometries was generated. The underlying optimization algorithm is governed by three highly composite parameters which model a combination of important aspects of the solution. Patient geometries were parametrized via volume- and shape properties of the voxel objects and overlap-volume histograms (OVH) of the planning-target-volume (PTV) and a relevant organ-at-risk (OAR). The impact of changes in one of the three optimization parameters on the maximally achievable value range of five dosimetric properties of the resulting dose distributions was studied. To predict the extent of this impact based on patient geometry, treatment site, and current parameter settings prior to optimization, three different ML-models were trained and tested. Precision-recall curves, as well as the area-under-curve (AUC) of the resulting receiver-operator-characteristic (ROC) curves were analyzed for model assessment. Results: Successful identification of parameter regions resulting in a high variability of dosimetric plan properties depended on the choice of geometry features, the treatment indication and the plan property under investigation. AUC values between 0.82 and 0.99 could be achieved. The best average-precision (AP) values obtained from the corresponding precision/recall curves ranged from 0.71 to 0.99. Conclusions: Machine learning models trained on a database of pre-optimized treatment plans can help finding relevant optimization parameter ranges prior to optimization. © 2021 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica},

abstract={Flood risk assessment is an important task for disaster management activities in flood-prone areas. Therefore, it is crucial to develop accurate flood risk assessment maps. In this study, we proposed a flood risk assessment framework which combines flood susceptibility assessment and flood consequences (human health and financial impact) for developing a final flood risk assessment map using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) method. Two hybrid Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, namely ABMDT (AdaBoost-DT) and BDT (Bagging-DT) were developed with Decision Table (DT) as a base classifier for creating a flood susceptibility map. We used 847 flood locations of major flooding events in the years 2007, 2009 and 2013 in Quang Nam province of Vietnam; and 14 flood influencing factors of topography, geology, hydrology and environment to construct and validate the hybrid AI models. Various statistical measures were used to validate the models, including the Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve called AUC. Results show that all the proposed models performed well, but the performance of the BDT model (AUC = 0.96) is the best in comparison to other models ABMDT (AUC = 0.953) and single DT (AUC = 0.929). Therefore, the flood susceptibility map produced by the BDT model was used to combine with a flood consequences map to develop a reliable flood risk assessment map for the study area. The final flood risk map can provide a useful source for better flood hazard management of the study area, and the proposed framework and models can be applied to other flood-prone areas. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={During the diagnosis of breast cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is supplied intravenously. Physicians recommend chemotherapy before surgery to reduce the invasive tumor’s large size. This research work suggests a model for Neural Network Ensemble Machine Learning, Implementation of a series of machine learning algorithms to create an enhanced and efficient predictable solution patients ‘maximum pathological response after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy. The quality of the neural network ensemble framework for machine learning is measured using multicriteria technique of decision making known as simple weighted additive (WSAW). The performance score for WSAW is calculated by taking into account ten measurements, namely accuracy, mean absolute error, root mean square error, TP rate, FP rate, accuracy, recall, F-measure, MCC, and ROC. The results are verified using the technique of cross-validation K-fold to achieve 97.20% accuracy. The findings are quite positive when the execution of the proposed system is coupled with the output of state-of-the-art classificators, for example, Bayes Net, Naïve Bayes, logistic, multilayer perceptron, SMO, voted perceptron, etc. With the increasing trend of artificial intelligence applications in cancer research, machine learning has a great future in forecasting and decision making. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The challenges in decision making can be viewed as selecting an appropriate method from multi-criteria decision making (MCDM). The MCDM methods do not offer similar answers to decision makers. In such cases, selection of the best answer becomes an issue. This is possible when there may be a better choice which was not considered or the unavailability of the right information at that time. MCDM contains a limited number of alternatives for every problem. In the initial process for the solution, all these solutions are explicitly identified. In this work, we have used machine learning techniques to fulfill the objective of MCDM also known as multi-criteria decision making (MCDM). The objective is to rank the movies by using various alternatives based on the weights of several criterions. In this proposed work, different kinds of movies like science fiction, cartoon, and adventures are used to generate the ranking. Other criterions that are used such as various factors like price, movie reviews and duration are used for movie ranking. The movie ranking is generated based on the weightage. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

abstract={Today, we are in the era of making multi-criteria decisions based on analysis of available data collected from autonomous databases that usually contain uncertain data. Skyline query technique returns a set of interesting objects (skylines) to the user by eliminating objects that are dominated by other objects within the database. Obviously, without doubt streamlining the process of processing skylines in providing answers to user-specified queries is inevitable. In this paper, we proposed SQUiD framework that combines an index-based technique with a prediction method to reduce the computational time for computing skylines over uncertain high-dimensional data. Through experimentations, results obtained clearly demonstrate the superiority of SQUiD framework over SkyQUD framework and BBIS algorithm. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

abstract={Since the first years of the 90s, recommender systems have emerged as effective tools for automatically selecting items according to user preferences. Traditional recommenders rely on the relevance assessments that users express using a single rating for each item. However, some authors started to suggest that this approach could be limited, as we naturally tend to formulate different judgments according to multiple criteria. During the last decade, several studies introduced novel recommender systems capable of exploiting user preferences expressed over multiple criteria. This work proposes a systematic literature review in the field of multicriteria recommender systems. Following a replicable protocol, we selected a total number of 93 studies dealing with this topic. We subsequently analyzed them to provide an answer to five different research questions. We considered what are the most common research problems, recommendation approaches, data mining and machine learning algorithms mentioned in these studies. Furthermore, we investigated the domains of application, the exploited evaluation protocols, metrics and datasets, and the most promising suggestions for future works. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Computing is a consortium of machine learning techniques which works well and provides a sufficient information to make assessment from the chronological historic dataset. In real today a lot of machine analytic techniques available to explore and to investigate the depth knowledge of the dataset but fails to work with multicriteria. There are domains with multicriteria-based decisions like agricultural, spatial, medical, and etc., These domain dataset requires expert intervention as multicriteria to streamline the knowledge presented from the efficient machine learning techniques. The analysis should extend with prescription in order to make productive actions from the learning. This research work is proposed to support the prescription of dataset with a simple automated framework to express the expert percepted value. The simple prescriptive-based domain data preprocessing technique (SP-DDPT) algorithms were defined to support the universal criteria such as ‘less than,’ ‘more than’ and ‘between.’ The proposed framework was applied to the sample Indian coastal dataset and the expert percepted value was preprocessed and prescribed successfully. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The provision of clean and safe drinking water is a crucial task for water supply companies from all over the world. To this end, automatic anomaly detection plays a critical role in drinking water quality monitoring. Recent anomaly detection studies use techniques that focus on a single global objective. Yet, companies need solutions that better balance the trade-off between false positives (FPs), which lead to financial losses to water companies, and false negatives (FNs), which severely impact public health and damage the environment. This work proposes a novel dynamic multi-criteria ensemble selection mechanism to cope with both problems simultaneously: the non-dominated local class-specific accuracy (NLCA). Moreover, experiments rely on recent time series related classification metrics to assess the predictive performance. Results on data from a real-world water distribution system show that NLCA outperforms other ensemble learning and dynamic ensemble selection techniques by more than 15% in terms of time series related F1 scores. As a conclusion, NLCA enables the development of stronger anomaly detection systems for drinking water quality monitoring.

abstract={Discovering association rules is a useful and common technique for data mining, in which relations and co-dependencies of datasets are shown. One of the most important challenges of data mining is to discover the rules of continuous numerical datasets. Furthermore, another restriction imposed by algorithms in this area is the need to determine the minimum threshold for the support and confidence criteria. In this paper, a multi-objective algorithm for mining quantitative association rules is proposed. The procedure is based on the genetic algorithm, and there is no need to determine the extent of the threshold for the support and confidence criteria. By proposing a multi-criteria method, useful and attractive rules and the most suitable numerical intervals are discovered, without the need to discretize numerical values and determine the minimum support threshold and minimum confidence threshold. Different criteria are considered to determine appropriate rules. In this algorithm, selected rules are extracted based on confidence, interestingness, and cosine2. The results obtained from real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The algorithm is used to examine three datasets, and the results show the superior performance of the proposed algorithm compared to similar algorithms. © 2020 Sharif University of Technology.

This study aims to develop and compare several interpolated Pareto surface similarity metrics. Materials and methods: The first metric is the root-mean-square error (RMSE) evaluated between vertices on the interpolated surfaces, augmented by intra-simplex sampling of the barycentric coordinates of the surfaces’ simplicial complexes. The second metric is the average projected distance (APD), which evaluates the displacements between the vertices and computes their projections along the mean displacement. The third metric is the average nearest-point distance (ANPD), which numerically integrates point-to-simplex distances over the sampled simplices of the interpolated surfaces. These metrics were compared by their convergence rates, the times required to achieve convergence, and their representation of the underlying surface interpolations. For analysis, several interpolated Pareto surface pairs were constructed abstractly, with one pair from a nasopharyngeal treatment planning case using MCO. Results: Convergence within 1% is typically achieved at approximately 50 and 80 samples per barycentric dimension for the RMSE and the ANPD, respectively. Calculation requires approximately 1 and 10 ms to achieve convergence for the RMSE and the ANPD in two dimensions, respectively, while the APD always requires < 1 ms. These time costs are much higher in higher dimensions for just the RMSE and ANPD. The APD values more closely approximated the ANPD limits than the RMSE limits. Conclusion: The ANPD’s formulation and generality make it likely more meaningful than the RMSE and APD for representing the similarity between the underlying interpolated surfaces rather than the sampling points on the surfaces. However, in situations requiring high-speed evaluations, the APD may be more desirable due to its speed, independence from a subjectively chosen sampling rate, and similarity to the ANPD limits. © 2020 American Association of Physicists in Medicine},

abstract={Objective: To improve patient safety and clinical outcomes by reducing the risk of prescribing errors, we tested the accuracy of a hybrid clinical decision support system in prioritizing prescription checks. Materials and Methods: Data from electronic health records were collated over a period of 18 months. Inferred scores at a patient level (probability of a patient's set of active orders to require a pharmacist review) were calculated using a hybrid approach (machine learning and a rule-based expert system). A clinical pharmacist analyzed randomly selected prescription orders over a 2-week period to corroborate our findings. Predicted scores were compared with the pharmacist's review using the area under the receiving-operating characteristic curve and area under the precision-recall curve. These metrics were compared with existing tools: computerized alerts generated by a clinical decision support (CDS) system and a literature-based multicriteria query prioritization technique. Data from 10 716 individual patients (133 179 prescription orders) were used to train the algorithm on the basis of 25 features in a development dataset. Results: While the pharmacist analyzed 412 individual patients (3364 prescription orders) in an independent validation dataset, the areas under the receiving-operating characteristic and precision-recall curves of our digital system were 0.81 and 0.75, respectively, thus demonstrating greater accuracy than the CDS system (0.65 and 0.56, respectively) and multicriteria query techniques (0.68 and 0.56, respectively). Discussion: Our innovative digital tool was notably more accurate than existing techniques (CDS system and multicriteria query) at intercepting potential prescription errors. Conclusions: By primarily targeting high-risk patients, this novel hybrid decision support system improved the accuracy and reliability of prescription checks in a hospital setting. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

abstract={Finding the precise value of pixel-scale evapotranspiration (ET) for an entire basin is a major challenge to hydrologists. Many efforts have been made to conquer this challenge, among which remote sensing methods are the most promising ones. The surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) is one of the several established remote sensing methods to estimate ET. The anchor pixel selection process (e.g., hot and cold pixels) is one of the critical steps in the SEBAL model that also determines the accuracy of the model outputs. Several researchers have improved anchor pixel selection by an automated fashion. In the current study, a new simple method has been proposed to seek the best anchor pixels. Then, the daily ET outputs were assessed using observed data from the Eddy covariance (EC) tower data at Santa Cruz River Watershed for 2014-2015. The results showed that the daily ET with measured data at the study site confirmed our automated anchor pixel selection method to be reliable in terms of selecting appropriate hot and cold pixels under dry conditions by producing ET maps with reasonable accuracies (R2=0.78 and RMSE=0.46 mm day-1). Our study suggests that considerations of simple image-derived parameters, such as temperature difference between hot and cold pixels, distance from a representative station, and elevation differences could improve the automatic selection of anchor pixels and the implementation of the SEBAL model under dry conditions. The machine learning technique could be combined with the proposed automated algorithm to map ET in different climates (not only arid and semiarid) faster and with more accuracy. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={Floods are one of the most widespread natural hazards occurring across the globe. The main objective of this study was to produce flood susceptibility maps for the province of Salzburg, Austria, using two multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) models including analytical hierarchical process (AHP) and analytical network process (ANP) and two machine learning (ML) models including random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM). Additionally, we compare which of the MCDA and ML models are better suited for flood susceptibility and evaluate the use of Dempster Shafer Theory (DST) for optimising the resulting flood susceptibility maps based on eleven flood conditioning factors: elevation, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI), stream power index (SPI), normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), geology, rainfall, land cover, distance to roads and distance to drainage. The accuracy evaluation of the flood susceptibility maps through the AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) method along with the relative flood density (R-Index) shows that RF (AUC = 87.8%) and SVM (AUC = 87%) outperform the ANP (AUC = 86.6%) and AHP (AUC = 85.9%) models. Therefore, the predictive performance of ML models was slightly better than the MCDA models. The DST could further increase the accuracy of both ML models (AUC = 88.3%) and MCDA models (AUC = 87.3%). However, the best accuracy (AUC = 89.3%) is reached through an ensemble of all four models. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Context: People who have recently recovered from the threat of deteriorating coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) have antibodies to the coronavirus circulating in their blood. Thus, the transfusion of these antibodies to deteriorating patients could theoretically help boost their immune system. Biologically, two challenges need to be surmounted to allow convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion to rescue the most severe COVID-19 patients. First, convalescent subjects must meet donor selection plasma criteria and comply with national health requirements and known standard routine procedures. Second, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems should be considered in the selection of the most suitable CP and the prioritisation of patients with COVID-19. Objective: This paper presents a rescue framework for the transfusion of the best CP to the most critical patients with COVID-19 on the basis of biological requirements by using machine learning and novel MCDM methods. Method: The proposed framework is illustrated on the basis of two distinct and consecutive phases (i.e. testing and development). In testing, ABO compatibility is assessed after classifying donors into the four blood types, namely, A, B, AB and O, to indicate the suitability and safety of plasma for administration in order to refine the CP tested list repository. The development phase includes patient and donor sides. In the patient side, prioritisation is performed using a contracted patient decision matrix constructed between ‘serological/protein biomarkers and the ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood to fractional inspired oxygen criteria’ and ‘patient list based on novel MCDM method known as subjective and objective decision by opinion score method’. Then, the patients with the most urgent need are classified into the four blood types and matched with a tested CP list from the test phase in the donor side. Thereafter, the prioritisation of CP tested list is performed using the contracted CP decision matrix. Result: An intelligence-integrated concept is proposed to identify the most appropriate CP for corresponding prioritised patients with COVID-19 to help doctors hasten treatments. Discussion: The proposed framework implies the benefits of providing effective care and prevention of the extremely rapidly spreading COVID-19 from affecting patients and the medical sector. © 2020},

abstract={Influence maximization problem is the procedure of attempting to identify a group of K nodes in a social network in order to maximize the dissemination of influence under certain influence models. Based on state transition algorithm (STA) and a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) method called Vise Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), a novel hybrid approach has been proposed to cope with the influence maximization problem in this paper. Firstly, an intelligent optimization paradigm called STA is introduced to obtain the most appropriate weights that are used to integrate the criteria of each alternative in the VIKOR method. Then, a hybrid normalization technique has been presented to allow the process of aggregating criterion with numerical and comparable data properly in this method. Several typical networks have been used to testify the effectiveness of proposed method and technique. Compared with other approaches, experimental results show that our approach can solve the influence maximization problem more effectively. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={With an unprecedented combination of mechanical and electrical properties, polymer nanocomposites have the potential to be widely used across multiple industries. Tailoring nanocomposites to meet application specific requirements remains a challenging task, owing to the vast, mixed-variable design space that includes composition (i.e. choice of polymer, nanoparticle, and surface modification) and microstructures (i.e. dispersion and geometric arrangement of particles) of the nanocomposite material. Modeling properties of the interphase, the region surrounding a nanoparticle, introduces additional complexity to the design process and requires computationally expensive simulations. As a result, previous attempts at designing polymer nanocomposites have focused on finding the optimal microstructure for only a fixed combination of constituents. In this article, we propose a data centric design framework to concurrently identify optimal composition and microstructure using mixed-variable Bayesian optimization. This framework integrates experimental data with state-of-the-art techniques in interphase modeling, microstructure characterization and reconstructions and machine learning. Latent variable Gaussian processes (LVGPs) quantifies the lack-of-data uncertainty over the mixed-variable design space that consists of qualitative and quantitative material design variables. The design of electrically insulating nanocomposites is cast as a multicriteria optimization problem with the goal of maximizing dielectric breakdown strength while minimizing dielectric permittivity and dielectric loss. Within tens of simulations, our method identifies a diverse set of designs on the Pareto frontier indicating the tradeoff between dielectric properties. These findings project data centric design, effectively integrating experimental data with simulations for Bayesian Optimization, as an effective approach for design of engineered material systems.

abstract={Estimating parameters for distributed hydrological models is a challenging and long studied task. Parameter transfer functions, which define model parameters as functions of geophysical properties of a catchment, might improve the calibration procedure, increase process realism, and can enable prediction in ungauged areas. We present the function space optimization (FSO), a symbolic regression method for estimating parameter transfer functions for distributed hydrological models. FSO is based on the idea of transferring the search for mathematical expressions into a continuous vector space that can be used for optimization. This is accomplished by using a text generating neural network with a variational autoencoder architecture that can learn to compress the information of mathematical functions. To evaluate the performance of FSO, we conducted a case study using a parsimonious hydrological model and synthetic discharge data. The case study consisted of two FSO applications: single-criteria FSO, where only discharge was used for optimization, and multicriteria FSO, where additional spatiotemporal observations of model states were used for transfer function estimation. The results show that FSO is able to estimate transfer functions correctly or approximate them sufficiently. We observed a reduced fit of the parameter density functions resulting from the inferred transfer functions for less sensitive model parameters. For those it was sufficient to estimate functions resulting in parameter distributions with approximately the same mean parameter values as the real transfer functions. The results of the multicriteria FSO showed that using multiple spatiotemporal observations for optimization increased the quality of estimation considerably. © 2020. The Authors.},

abstract={Flood is a devastating natural hazard that may cause damage to the environment infrastructure, and society. Hence, identifying the susceptible areas to flood is an important task for every country to prevent such dangerous consequences. The present study developed a framework for identifying flood-prone areas of the Topľa river basin, Slovakia using geographic information system (GIS), multi-criteria decision making approach (MCDMA), bivariate statistics (Frequency Ratio (FR), Statistical Index (SI)) and machine learning (Naïve Bayes Tree (NBT), Logistic Regression (LR)). To reach such a goal, different physical-geographical factors (criteria) were integrated and mapped. To access the relationship and interdependences among the criteria, decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and analytic network process (ANP) were used. Based on the experts’ decisions, the DEMATEL-ANP model was used to compute the relative weights of different criteria and a GIS-based linear combination was performed to derive the susceptibility index. Separately, the flood susceptibility index computation through NBT-FR and NBT-SI hybrid models assumed, in the first stage, the estimation of the weight of each class/category of conditioning factor through SI and FR and the integration of these values in NBT algorithm. The application of LR stand-alone required the calculation of the weights of conditioning factors by analysing their spatial relation with the location of the historical flood events. The study revealed that very high and high flood susceptibility classes covered between 20% and 47% of the study area, respectively. The validation of results, using the past flood points, highlighted that the hybrid DEMATEL-ANP model was the most performant with an Area Under ROC curve higher than 0.97, an accuracy of 0.922 and a value of HSS of 0.844. The presented methodological approach used for the identification of flood susceptible areas can serve as an alternative for the updating of preliminary flood risk assessment based on the EU Floods Directive. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The authors propose a model for assessing the quality of the designed services at the early stages of their life cycle. The model integrates the qualitative and quantitative indicators of the future service and includes the forecasted needs of consumers, based on which one can assess their potential demand and competitiveness by the criterion of price / quality ratio. The proposed model has two distinctive features. Firstly, forecasting customer requirements for the quality of services is based on the results of machine learning on data of existing and potential customers, as well as based on the accumulated knowledge base of consumer experience and expert opinions. Secondly, the model involves multi-criteria optimization, while some of the optimized parameters are discrete or qualitative (verbal, non-digital, non-measureable). In conclusion, the authors demonstrated the advantages of the developed model by the examples of the transport and logistics business in the field of passenger and freight transportation in Russia. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Coastal areas are expected to be at a higher risk of flooding when climate change-induced sea-level rise (SLR) is combined with episodic rises in sea level. Flood susceptibility mapping (FSM), mostly based on statistical and machine learning methods, has been widely employed to mitigate flood risk; however, they neglect exposure and vulnerability assessment as the key components of flood risk. Flood risk assessment is often conducted by quantitative methods (e.g., probabilistic). Such assessment uses analytical and empirical techniques to construct the physical vulnerability curves of elements at risk, but the role of people's capacity, depending on social vulnerability, remains limited. To address this gap, this study developed a semiquantitative method, based on the spatial multi-criteria decision analysis (SMCDA). The model combines two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios: RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5, and factors triggering coastal flooding in Bandar Abbas, Iran. It also employs an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) model to weight indicators of hazard, exposure, and social vulnerability components. Under the most extreme flooding scenario, 14.8% of flooded areas were identified as high and very high risk, mostly located in eastern, western, and partly in the middle of the City. The results of this study can be employed by decision-makers to apply appropriate risk reduction strategies in high-risk flooding zones. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Biosphere Reserves are archetypal parts of natural and cultural landscapes encompassing over large area of different ecosystem, it represents bio-geographic zones of an region. Globally, the areas of biosphere reserve is shrinking and exploiting due to the extreme climatic condition, natural calamities and anthropogenic activities, which leads to environmental and land degradation. In this paper Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (NBSR) area has been selected and it represents a biodiversity-rich ecosystem in the Western Ghats and includes two of the ten biogeographical provinces of India. Amongst the most insubstantial ecosystems in the world, the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve is bearing the substance of climate change evident in increasingly unpredictable rainfall and higher temperatures during recent years. The region was mostly unscathed till two centuries ago, but has witnessed large-scale destruction ever since. In this scenario, a need of application of remote sensing and advance machine learning techniques to monitor environmental degradation and its ecosystem in NBSR is more essential. The objective of the present study is to develop satellite image classification techniques that can reliably to map forest cover and land use, and provide the basis for long-term monitoring. Advanced image classification techniques on the cloud-based platform Google Earth Engine (GEE) for mapping vegetation and land use types, and analyse their spatial distributions. To restore degraded ecosystems to their natural conditions through proper management and conservation practices. In order to understand the nature of environmental degradation and its ecosystem in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve; following thematic criteria's were grouped in to four major indicators such as Terrain Indicator (TI), Environmental Indicator (EI), Hydro-Meteorological Indicator (HMI) and Socio-Economic Indicator (SEI). The utilisation of remote sensing product of huge datasets and various data product in analysis and advanced machine learning algorithm through Google earth engine are indispensable. After extraction of all the thematic layers by using multi criteria decision and fuzzy linear member based weight and ranks were assigned and overlay in GIS environment at a common pixel size of 30 m. Based on the analysis the resultant layer has been classified into five environmental degraded classes i.e., very high, high, moderate, slight and no degradation. This study is help to identify the degradation and long term monitoring and suggest the appropriate conservation, management and policies, it is a time to implement and protect the Nilgiri biosphere reserves without hindering present stage of natural environment in a sustainable manner. © 2020 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.},

abstract={Combining neural networks with continuous logic and multicriteria decision-making tools can reduce the black-box nature of neural models. In this study, we show that nilpotent logical systems offer an appropriate mathematical framework for hybridization of continuous nilpotent logic and neural models, helping to improve the interpretability and safety of machine learning. In our concept, perceptrons model soft inequalities; namely membership functions and continuous logical operators. We design the network architecture before training, using continuous logical operators and multicriteria decision tools with given weights working in the hidden layers. Designing the structure appropriately leads to a drastic reduction in the number of parameters to be learned. The theoretical basis offers a straightforward choice of activation functions (the cutting function or its differentiable approximation, the squashing function), and also suggests an explanation to the great success of the rectified linear unit (ReLU). In this study, we focus on the architecture of a hybrid model and introduce the building blocks for future applications in deep neural networks. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Preference learning is a subfield of machine learning. In the preference learning-fused decision analysis, the utility values of alternatives are inducted from human decision behavior. The commonly used utility model is the weighted summation. The model assumes the independency between criteria and the same attitude towards each performance value of alternatives, which is often unrealistic in practice. To solve this problem, this study presents an ACI-SMAA (Attitudinal Choquet Integral-based Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis) model to consider the criteria interaction and attitudinal parameter of human decision behavior in decision analysis. The ACI-SMAA model is helpful to learn human preferences and analyze latent correlations. An application example about household energy selection is used to show the applicability and validity of the proposed model. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Accounting for about 290,000–650,000 deaths across the globe, seasonal influenza is estimated by the World Health Organization to be a major cause of mortality. Hence, there is a need for a reliable and robust epidemiological surveillance decision-making system to understand and combat this epidemic disease. In a previous study, the authors proposed a decision support system to fight against seasonal influenza. This system is composed of three subsystems: (i) modeling and simulation, (ii) data warehousing, and (iii) analysis. The analysis subsystem relies on spatial online analytical processing (S-OLAP) technology. Although the S-OLAP technology is useful in analyzing multidimensional spatial data sets, it cannot take into account the inherent multicriteria nature of seasonal influenza risk assessment by itself. Therefore, the objective of this article is to extend the existing decision support system by adding advanced multicriteria analysis capabilities for enhanced seasonal influenza risk assessment and monitoring. Bearing in mind the characteristics of the decision problem considered in this article, a well-known multicriteria classification method, the dominance-based rough set approach (DRSA), was selected to boost the existing decision support system. Combining the S-OLAP technology and the multicriteria classification method DRSA in the same decision support system will largely improve and extend the scope of analysis capabilities. The extended decision support system has been validated by its application to assess seasonal influenza risk in the northwest region of Algeria. © 2020 Society for Risk Analysis},

abstract={Construction engineering and management are vital for successful project execution, and both researchers and practitioners continually seek ways to improve construction processes. Fuzzy logic plays an important role in many construction engineering and management applications, which are reviewed in this paper. This paper discusses the limitations of fuzzy logic and how this theory has been combined with other modeling techniques to develop fuzzy hybrid techniques, and describes the aspects of construction problems and decision making that are most effectively modeled using these techniques. Fuzzy hybrid techniques that are most common in construction are presented and examples from construction literature and the author's research program are provided. The author shares her vision of future research in this area, which is based on her expertise and experiences collaborating with construction industry partners, who have helped shape her research program and its impact on industry. Finally, the author presents her thoughts on the challenges construction researchers face in translating research to practice and measuring its impact, and she discusses some potential solutions from her research program. This paper is based on the 2019 Peurifoy Construction Advancement Address, which the author presented in Montreal, Canada, in June 2019. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

funding_text 2={The author’s industry partnerships have brought together owners, contractors, and labor groups, some of which are direct competitors, to collaborate on issues of industry-wide importance. Through these partnerships, some of which have spanned close to 23 years, she has contributed to a culture of university-industry collaboration where each party views the other as part of the fabric of doing business and increasing knowledge in the construction domain. The multiple and diverse perspectives of her industry partners have enabled her and her team to carry out research that is important to all parties in construction and to develop comprehensive solutions that can only be addressed through a multiparty collaborative effort. The long-term sustained funding from the NSERC IRC has ensured the continuity of her research program by providing uninterrupted financial support. This program has also helped ensure that industry partners provide meaningful input to the research by contributing to the definition of problems and providing extensive in-kind support, including access to expert knowledge and data. The consistency of her partners has also ensured that her research evolves over time to address the most relevant issues facing the industry.},

abstract={The loading of the ship is investigated under fully loaded and ballast conditions. Each case is categorized numerically under 1 and 0 for fully loaded and ballast conditions, respectively. The multi criteria decision making (MCDM) method is applied to advance and support the decision-making system for ship operations and ship owners. The parameters analysed in this research include wind speed, wave height, ship speed, distance travelled, and shaft speed. The fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (Fuzzy-AHP) method has been used to prioritise the weight of criteria decision making. They will provide a fundamental criterion to support the commercial stakeholders, loading & navigation of the vessels. The novelty methodology indicates that machine learning could be used in decision making for optimal loading of the ship. The optimal loading of the ship and fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine has been achieved from this research by the proposed methodology. The results of this research are useful for shipping transportation companies and especially as a tool for the Master and the Chief Engineer of ships and researchers in the field of ship energy efficiency management. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Exposure to indoor radon at home and in workplaces constitutes a serious public health risk and is the second most prevalent cause of lung cancer after tobacco smoking. Indoor radon concentration is to a large extent controlled by so-called geogenic radon, which is radon generated in the ground. While indoor radon has been mapped in many parts of Europe, this is not the case for its geogenic control, which has been surveyed exhaustively in only a few countries or regions. Since geogenic radon is an important predictor of indoor radon, knowing the local potential of geogenic radon can assist radon mitigation policy in allocating resources and tuning regulations to focus on where it needs to be prioritized. The contribution of geogenic to indoor radon can be quantified in different ways: the geogenic radon potential (GRP) and the geogenic radon hazard index (GRHI). Both are constructed from geogenic quantities, with their differences tending to be, but not always, their type of geographical support and optimality as indoor radon predictors. An important feature of the GRHI is consistency across borders between regions with different data availability and Rn survey policies, which has so far impeded the creation of a European map of geogenic radon. The GRHI can be understood as a generalization or extension of the GRP. In this paper, the concepts of GRP and GRHI are discussed and a review of previous GRHI approaches is presented, including methods of GRHI estimation and some preliminary results. A methodology to create GRHI maps that cover most of Europe appears at hand and appropriate; however, further fine tuning and validation remains on the agenda. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Recommender systems (RSs) are personalization tools that gives recommendations for items to users by exploiting various methods. Conventional collaborative filtering (CF) based RSs provide suggestions to users based on overall rating of items which is not an efficient procedure as users in system may have different choices on different criteria. So, multicriteria recommender systems (MCRS) came into existence as an extension of traditional CF based RSs. MCRS recommends items to users based on number of criteria. Recommending products to users from the vast catalog is still a challenge for researchers. This paper presents a review of some significant work in the area of multi-criteria recommender system. After a brief introduction, we present review of existing methods categories according to heuristic and model based approach, and some of the popular approaches are classified into different sets such as recommendation fields, research problem, data mining and machine learning techniques. Insights and possible future work in the area of MCRSs are also discussed. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Taking into account the exponential growth of the number of flash-floods events worldwide, the detection of areas prone to these natural hazards is one of the main activities taken in order to mitigate the negative effects of these risk phenomena. In the present paper, new modeling approaches, Alternating Decision Tree (ADT) integrated with IOE (ADT-IOE) and ADT integrated with AHP (ADT-AHP), were proposed for flash-flood susceptibility mapping across the Suha river catchment (Romania). Besides, two stand-alone methods, Index of Entropy (IOE) and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), were also investigated. For this regard, 111 torrential points and 111 non-torrential points along with 8 flash-flood conditioning factors have been involved in the training process of the four models. The quality of the flash-flood models was checked by using the ROC Curve method, classification accuracy (CLA), and Kappa index. The result shows that the two ensemble models, the ADT-IOE (AUC = 0.972, CLC = 86.37%, Kappa statistics = 0.727) and the ADT-AHP (AUC = 0.926, CLA = 87.88%, Kappa statistics = 0.758), have high prediction performance and outperform the other models. Therefore, ADT-IOE and ADT-AHP are new and promising tools for flash-flood susceptibility modeling. © 2018},

abstract={Understanding what Machine Learning models are doing is not always trivial. This is especially true for complex models such as Deep Neural Networks (DNN), which are the best-suited algorithms for modeling very complex and nonlinear relationships. But this need to understand has become a must since privacy regulations are hardening the industrial use of these models. There are different techniques to address the interpretability issues that Machine Learning models arises. This paper is focused on opening the so-called Deep Neural architectures black-box. This research extends the technique called Layer-wise Relevant Propagation (LRP) enhancing its properties to compute the most critical paths in different deep neural architectures using multicriteria analysis. We call this technique Ranked-LRP and it was tested on four different datasets and tasks, including classification and regression. The results show the worth of our proposal. © 2019},

abstract={The widespread distribution of precision farming systems necessitates improvements in the methods for the control of unmanned harvesting equipment (UHE). While unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide an effective solution to this problem, there are many challenges in the implementation of technology. This paper considers the problem of identifying optimal routes of UHE movement as a multicriteria evaluation problem, which can be solved by a nonlinear scheme of compromises. The proposed method uses machine learning algorithms and statistical processing of the spectral characteristics obtained from UAV digital images. Developed method minimizes the resources needed for a harvesting campaign and reduces the costs of fuel consumption. © 2020 TSI® Press.},

abstract={Gully erosion is a problem; therefore, it must be predicted using highly accurate predictive models to avoid losses caused by gully development and to guarantee sustainable development. This research investigates the predictive performance of seven multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM), statistical, and machine learning (ML)-based models and their ensembles for gully erosion susceptibility mapping (GESM). A case study of the Dasjard River watershed, Iran uses a database of 306 gully head cuts and 15 conditioning factors. The database was divided 70:30 to train and verify the models. Their performance was assessed with the area under prediction rate curve (AUPRC), the area under success rate curve (AUSRC), accuracy, and kappa. Results show that slope is key to gully formation. The maximum entropy (ME) ML model has the best performance (AUSRC = 0.947, AUPRC = 0.948, accuracy = 0.849 and kappa = 0.699). The second best is the random forest (RF) model (AUSRC = 0.965, AUPRC = 0.932, accuracy = 0.812 and kappa = 0.624). By contrast, the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) model was the least effective (AUSRC = 0.871, AUPRC = 0.867, accuracy = 0.758 and kappa = 0.516). RF increased the performance of statistical index (SI) and frequency ratio (FR) statistical models. Furthermore, the combination of a generalized linear model (GLM), and functional data analysis (FDA) improved their performances. The results demonstrate that a combination of geographic information systems (GIS) with remote sensing (RS)-based ML models can successfully map gully erosion susceptibility, particularly in low-income and developing regions. This method can aid the analyses and decisions of natural resources managers and local planners to reduce damages by focusing attention and resources on areas prone to the worst and most damaging gully erosion. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Erosion is a natural phenomenon that happens in all ecosystems, whether due to weather conditions or inappropriate land use. Mapping the erosion vulnerability levels of an area can occur using different methods of geographic inference. However, defining the appropriate method is still a question to be answered. This paper presents an erosion vulnerability map validation approach elaborated by different inference methods. As a case study, a watershed was adopted and the following criteria were considered: geomorphology, pedology, slope, drainage density and land cover. Among the tested methods are: Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) and three Fuzzy operators: algebraic sum, algebraic product and gamma, varying the exponent “γ” between the values 0.4; 0.6 and 0.8. The weights of the criteria were defined based on the Hierarchical Analytical Process. The validation of the maps took place using 1902 points, with 951 erosion points in the area defined based on Google Earth Pro images and 951 points without erosion randomly generated in QGIS 3.8. The logistic regression model was used to compare the performance of each map by pointing out the areas with the highest and lowest degree of vulnerability. The best modeling was achieved with the Fuzzy gamma operator when parameterized with γ = 0.6. Although WLC is the recurring approach in environmental studies involving geographic inference, our results show that other operators can produce results closer to those encountered with the reality observed in the field.

abstract={Components are the significant part of a system which plays an important role in the functionality of the system. Components are the reusable part of a system which are already tested, debugged, and experienced based on the previous practices. A new system is developed based on the reusable components, as reusability of components is recommended to save time, effort, and resources as such components are already made. Security of components is a significant constituent of the system to maintain the existence of the component as well as the system to function smoothly. Component security can protect a component from illegal access and changing its contents. Considering the developments in information security, protecting the components becomes a fundamental issue. In order to tackle such issues, a comprehensive study report is needed which can help practitioners to protect their system. The current study is an endeavor to report some of the existing studies regarding component security evaluation based on multicriteria decision and machine learning algorithms in the popular searching libraries. © 2020 Jibin Zhang et al.},

abstract={The work is devoted to the research and development of a prototype information system for finding the best route for electric vehicles. Available approaches and software for optimal travel planning are explored. The algorithm for optimizing the choice of charging stations along the route is proposed. Algorithms for finding routes between charging stations on a graph are improved. The multicriteria problem of choosing the optimal solution by the method of global criterion is solved. Charging stations can be selected depending on the charging time and the number of charging stations. We use the object-oriented approach for information systems design. The application requirements are justified. Considering the features of the iOS platform, the REST architecture was used. Test analysis confirmed the effectiveness of the program. The construction of the best route depends on the type of vehicle, battery capacity, distance and number of charging stations available. © Copyright 2020 for this paper by its authors.},

abstract={For a centralized retail chain where everything is controlled centrally for all the outlets, to monitor the performances of all outlets and identify the problems in product level, is difficult than in a decentralized retail chain. A centralized retail chain having twenty-two outlets and eight thousand six hundred and ninety-three unique products, has been considered for this study. In this paper, we used K-mean clustering as a machine learning tool to cluster the outlets from where we measured each cluster's performance. To further analyze at product level, we used analytical hierarchy process (AHP), as multi criteria decision-making technique, for cluster wise inventory classification. Revenue per square foot and average basket value for each cluster, is the basic performance indicator. From basic performance indicator, decision makers can get an idea about which cluster needs immediate attention. This will lead them to investigate that cluster's class wise inventory situation for performance improvement. © Interconnected Supply Chains in an Era of Innovation - Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Information Systems, Logistics and Supply Chain, ILS 2020.

abstract={Recent developments in the field of recommender systems have led to a renewed interest in employing some of the sophisticated machine learning algorithms to combine multiple characteristics of items during the process of making recommendations. Considerable number of research papers have been published on multi-criteria recommendation techniques. Most of these studies have focused only on using some basic statistical methods or simply by extending the similarity computation of the traditional heuristic-based techniques to model the system. Researchers have not treated the uncertainty that exists about the relationship between multi-criteria modelling approaches and effectiveness of some of the complex and powerful machine learning techniques; in fact, no previous study has investigated the role of artificial neural networks to design and develop the system using aggregation function approach. This paper seeks to remedy these challenges by analysing the performance of multi-criteria recommender systems, modelled by integrating an adaptive linear neuron that was trained using delta rule, and asymmetric singular value decomposition algorithms. The proposed model was implemented, trained and tested using a multi-criteria dataset for recommending movies to users based on action, story, direction, and visual effects of movies. Taken together, the empirical results of the study suggested that there is a strong association between artificial neural networks and the modelling approaches of multicriteria recommendation technique. © 2020 Science and Information Organization.},

abstract={Preference learning methods are commonly used in multicriteria analysis. The working principle of these methods is similar to classical machine learning techniques. A common issue to both machine learning and preference learning methods is the difficulty of the definition of decision classes and the assignment of objects to these classes, especially for large datasets. This paper proposes two procedures permitting to automatize the construction of decision classes. It also proposes two simple refinement procedures, that rely on the 80-20 principle, permitting to map the output of the construction procedures into a manageable set of decision classes. The proposed construction procedures rely on the most elementary preference relation, namely dominance relation, which avoids the need for additional information or distance/(di)similarity functions, as with most of existing clustering methods. Furthermore, the simplicity of the 80-20 principle on which the refinement procedures are based, make them very adequate to large datasets. Proposed procedures are illustrated and validated using real-world datasets. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This work proposes a new approach by integrating statistical, machine learning, and multi-criteria decision analysis, including artificial neural network (ANN), logistic regression (LR), frequency ratio (FR), and analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Dependent (flood inventory) and independent variables (flood causative factors) were prepared using remote sensing data and the Mike-11 hydrological model and secondary data from different sources. The flood inventory map was randomly divided into training and testing datasets, where 334 flood locations (70%) were used for training and the remaining 141 locations (30%) were employed for testing. Using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), predictive power of the model was tested. The results revealed that LR model had the highest success rate (81.60%) and prediction rate (86.80%), among others. Furthermore, different combinations of the models were evaluated for flood susceptibility mapping and the best combination (11C) was used for generating a new flood hazard map for Bangladesh. The performance of the 11C integrated models was also evaluated using the AUROC and found that integrated LR-FR model had the highest predictive power with an AUROC value of 88.10%. This study offers a new opportunity to the relevant authority for planning and designing flood control measures. © 2019, King Abdulaziz University and Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This paper proposes a hybrid method for online reviews analysis through multi-criteria decision-making, text mining and predictive learning techniques to find the relative importance of factors affecting travelers' decision-making in selecting green hotels with spa services. The proposed method is developed for the first time in the context of tourism and hospitality by this research, especially for customer segmentation in green hotels through customers' online reviews. We use Self-Organizing Map (SOM) for cluster analysis, Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA) technique for analyzing textual reviews, Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for ranking hotel features, and Neuro-Fuzzy technique to reveal the customer satisfaction levels. The impact of green hotels with spa and non-spa services on travelers' satisfaction is investigated for four travelling groups: Travelled solo, Travelled with family, Travelled as a couple and Travelled with friends. The proposed method is evaluated on the travelers' reviews on 152 hotels in Malaysia. The findings of this study provide an important method for travelers' decision-making for hotel selection through User-Generated Content (UGC) and help hotel managers to improve their service quality and marketing strategies. © 2019 by the authors.},

Method: Our approach is based on the combination of semantic technologies with MCDA (Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding) that allowed us to build a two level decision support model. Given a specific domain, the approach assesses the adequacy of an alternative/action (prescription of antibiotic) for a specific subject (patient) with an issue (bacterial infection) in a given context (medical). The goal of the first level of the decision support model is to select the set of alternatives which have the potential to be suitable. Then the second level sorts the alternatives into categories according to their adequacy using an MCDA sorting method (MR–Sort with Veto) and a structured set of description logic queries. Results: We applied this approach in the domain of antibiotic prescriptions, working closely with the EpiCura Hospital Center (BE). Its performance was compared to the EpiCura recommendation guidelines which are currently in use. The results showed that the proposed system is more consistent in its recommendations when compared with the static EpiCura guidelines. Moreover, with PARS the antibiotic prescribing workflow becomes more flexible. PARS allows the user (physician) to update incrementally and dynamically a patient's profile with more information, or to input knowledge modifications that accommodate the decision context (like the introduction of new side effects and antibiotics, the development of germs that are resistant, etc). At the end of our evaluation, we detail a number of limitations of the current version of PARS and discuss future perspectives. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Travelers can enjoy a wide range of choices with the assistance of online review websites such as TripAdvisor. Online reviews provided by customers are an important portion of hotels' online business worldwide as they have value in terms of understanding customers' observations of hotels' product and service features. Hotel managers seek to understand travelers' satisfaction and hotel preferences through online reviews to improve their marketing strategy and decision making. This research uses the travelers' generated content in online hotel reviews to provide reasonable and benchmarking understandings about customers' satisfaction and preferences. Hence, the aim of this study is identifying the important factors for hotel selection based on previous travelers' reviews on TripAdvisor. Accordingly, we develop a new method for the use of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) and soft computing approaches. Concentrating on the case study of the Canary Islands hotels, we show how this method can be applied to determine the satisfaction and preferences among travelers that impact their decision in hotel choices. The results help to identify four customer segments for Canary Islands hotels. These segments are “Highly Satisfied Travelers”, “Satisfied Travelers”, “Moderately Satisfied Travelers”, and “Unsatisfied Travelers”, showing that different travelers have various degrees of satisfaction with dissimilar preferences. We found that travelers' preference and satisfaction segmentation is a crucial stage in travelers' behavior analysis to improve the quality of hotels' products and services. This form of analysis can enhance hotel managers' understanding of different market segments according to customers’ satisfaction level and their preferences. The findings of this study will help managers to set priority instructions for improving the corresponding hotel features and use online customer reviews to improve customer satisfaction and hotel performance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Traffic classification in computer networks has very significant roles in network operation, management, and security. Examples include controlling the flow of information, allocating resources effectively, provisioning quality of service, detecting intrusions, and blocking malicious and unauthorized access. This problem has attracted a growing attention over years and a number of techniques have been proposed ranging from traditional port-based and payload inspection of TCP/IP packets to supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised machine learning paradigms. With the increasing complexity of network environments and support for emerging mobility services and applications, more robust and accurate techniques need to be investigated. In this paper, we propose a new supervised hybrid machine-learning approach for ubiquitous traffic classification based on multicriteria fuzzy decision trees with attribute selection. Moreover, our approach can handle well the imbalanced datasets and zero-day applications (i.e., those without previously known traffic patterns). Evaluating the proposed methodology on several benchmark real-world traffic datasets of different nature demonstrated its capability to effectively discriminate a variety of traffic patterns, anomalies, and protocols for unencrypted and encrypted traffic flows. Comparing with other methods, the performance of the proposed methodology showed remarkably better classification accuracy. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Gully erosion is considered as a severe environmental problem in many areas of the world which causes huge damages to agricultural lands and infrastructures (i.e. roads, buildings, and bridges); however, gully erosion modeling and prediction with high accuracy are still difficult due to the complex interactions of various factors. The objective of this research was to develop and introduce three new ensemble models, which were based on Complex Proportional Assessment of Alternatives (COPRAS), Logistic Regression (LR), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Random Forest (RF), and Frequency Ratio (FR) for spatial prediction of gully erosion with a case study at the Najafabad watershed (Iran). For this purpose, a total of 290 head-cut of gullies and 17 conditioning factors were collected and used to establish a geospatial database. Subsequently, FR was used to determine the spatial relationship between the conditioning factors and the head-cut of gullies, whereas RF, BRT, and LR were used to quantify the relative importance of these factors. In the next step, three ensemble gully erosion models, named COPRAS-FR-RF, COPRAS-FR-BRT, and COPRAS-FR-LR were developed and verified. The Success Rate Curve (SRC), and the Prediction Rate Curve (PRC) and their areas under the curves (AUC) were used to check the performance of the three proposed models. The result showed that Soil group, geomorphology, and drainage density factors played the key role on the occurrence of the gully erosion. All the three models have very high degree-of-fit and the prediction performance, the COPRAS-FR-RF model (AUC-SRC = 0.974 and AUC-PRC = 0.929), the COPRAS-FR-BRT model (AUC-SRC = 0.973 and AUC-PRC = 0.928), and the COPRAS-FR-LR model (AUC-SRC = 0.972 and AUC-PRC = 0.926); therefore, it is concluded that they are efficient and new powerful tools which could be used for predicting gully erosion in prone-areas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Polarimetric features of PolSAR images include inherent scattering mechanisms of terrain types, which are important for classification and other Earth observation applications. By using target decomposition methods, many polarimetric scattering components can be obtained. Besides, the elements of a coherency/covariance matrix, as well as polarimetric descriptors, such as SPAN, single-bounce eigenvalue relative difference/double-bounce eigenvalue relative difference, etc., can also provide characteristic information. In fact, more and more polarimetric decomposition components and descriptors have been proposed; the computation cost increases if all of them are employed as the input of the classification process. Although all these features obtained from the coherency/covariance matrix are not independent, still, finding out which ones are significant for the classification of different terrain types will improve the understanding of scattering mechanisms. In this article, the effective polarimetric feature combination is studied based on the vegetation classification performance of support vector machine (SVM) and nearest-regularized subspace (NRS) machine learning approaches, as well as their combinations with a Markov random field (MRF). A framework on the basis of similarity and the orthogonal subspace projection (OSP) method in a hyperspectral area is used to select the polarimetric features. For the airborne PolSAR data in Flevoland, The Netherlands, 107 polarimetric features are extracted, including matrix elements, target decomposition components, and polarimetric descriptors. A subset is selected by using the proposed and OSP methods. They have a good classification accuracy evaluated by SVM+MRF and NRS+MRF classifiers. However, when the SVM and the NRS are used without combining spatial information of the MRF, the features selected by the proposed framework with correlation coefficient criteria have much better classification performance than those of OSP and principal component analysis. © 2008-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={After more than a decade, the supply-driven approach to publishing public (open) data has resulted in an ever-growing number of data silos. Hundreds of thousands of datasets have been catalogued and can be accessed at data portals at different administrative levels. However, usually, users do not think in terms of datasets when they search for information. Instead, they are interested in information that is most likely scattered across several datasets. In the world of proprietary incompany data, organizations invest heavily in connecting data in knowledge graphs and/or store data in data lakes with the intention of having an integrated view of the data for analysis. With the rise of machine learning, it is a common belief that governments can improve their services, for example, by allowing citizens to get answers related to government information from virtual assistants like Alexa or Siri. To provide high-quality answers, these systems need to be fed with knowledge graphs. In this paper, we share our experience of constructing and using the first open government knowledge graph in the Netherlands. Based on the developed demonstrators, we elaborate on the value of having such a graph and demonstrate its use in the context of improved data browsing, multicriteria analysis for urban planning, and the development of location-aware chat bots. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={The increasing competition among industries has led to the emergence of numerous tools and methods to support decision making focused on assets maintenance in a company, since ensuring good maintenance is directly linked with greater reliability and uptime for equipment, reducing losses in production processes and consequently increasing profitability. This work aims to use Machine Learning (ML) algorithms - Bayesian Networks (BN) and attribute relevance analysis (ARA), implemented in the Weka® platform, to process a dataset of event logs failure of industrial machine components. The approach aims to use the conditional probability relations generated by the BN and the ranking of criteria relevance for the design of an AHP decision-making model within the scope of industrial maintenance to prioritize which components of a specific machine are more susceptible to failures. The proposed integration mechanism aims to bring greater reliability to the weights assigned to the criteria of the AHP model, and consequently, a more accurate decision support. The results showed that the AHP model generated from a Bayesian Network is consistent with the conditional probabilities estimated by the BN, giving robustness to the decision sphere in the context of industrial maintenance. This AHP model can serve as a basis to be complemented by qualitative analysis criteria according to the need of the individual specialist, allowing the construction of strategic maintenance action plans. © 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Understanding human mobility is significant in many fields, such as geography, transportation, and sociology. Due to the wide spatiotemporal coverage and low operational cost, mobile phone data have been recognized as a major resource for human mobility research. However, due to conflicts between the data sparsity problem of mobile phone data and the requirement of fine-scale solutions, trajectory reconstruction is of considerable importance. Although there have been initial studies on this problem, existing methods rarely consider the effect of similarities among individuals and the patterns of missing data. To address this issue, we propose a multi-criteria data partitioning trajectory reconstruction (MDP-TR) method for large-scale mobile phone data. In the proposed method, a multi-criteria data partitioning (MDP) technique is used to measure the similarity among individuals in near real-time and investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of missing data. With this technique, the trajectory reconstruction from mobile phone data is then conducted with machine learning models. We verified the method using a real mobile phone dataset in a large city. Results indicate that the MDP-TR method outperforms competing methods in both accuracy and robustness. We argue that the MDP-TR method can be effectively utilized for grasping highly dynamic human movement status and improving the spatiotemporal resolution of human mobility research. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A multi-criteria decision-making approach was used for the selection of GCMs for Nigeria based on their ability to replicate historical rainfall estimated using three entropy-based feature selection methods namely, Entropy Gain (EG), Gain Ratio (GR), and Symmetrical Uncertainty (SU). Performances of four bias correction methods were compared to identify the most suitable method for downscaling and projection of rainfall using the selected GCMs. Random forest (RF) regression was used for the generation of the multi-model ensemble (MME) average of projected rainfall. The ensemble projections for each of the representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 were computed and compared with global precipitation climatology centre (GPCC) historical rainfall of Nigeria to assess the percentage changes in annual rainfall with 95% level of confidence at different ecological zones for three future periods 2010–2039, 2040–2069, and 2070–2099. Quantile regression was used to assess the changes in seasonal rainfall at 95% confidence interval over the present century. The results revealed that MRI-CGCM3, HadGEM2-ES, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0 and CESM1-CAM5 are the most suitable GCMs for the projection of rainfall in Nigeria. The linear scaling method was found as the most suitable approach for downscaling of rainfall in terms of all the statistical indices used. It was found to downscale rainfall with normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) in the range of 30.7–44.0%, while Nash-Sutcliff efficiency (NSE) was between 0.81 and 0.91, and modified coefficient of agreement (md) was between 0.82 and 0.88. Projection of rainfall showed no significant change in Nigeria over the century under RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 6.5, while RCP 8.5 showed a decrease in the last part of the century (2070–2099). The seasonal changes in rainfall showed an increase in rainfall in the range of 0–20% in most parts of the north. The methodology in this study can reduce the uncertainty inherent in climate change projection and produce better projection of possible spatial and temporal changes in annual and seasonal rainfall. © 2019},

abstract={This paper presents a learning model for the automated generation of built environments, demonstrated by the creation of minimal apartments situated in dense urban settings. The research utilizes the techniques of parametric modelling, multi-criteria optimization and supervised machine learning to provide 3D configurations of minimal apartments with improved visibility from significant viewpoints, and with a functional layout defined by ‘the wisdom of the crowd’. The model seeks to maximize the measured 3D visibility in generated units–an attribute associated with low perceived density, recognized as having a positive effect on the well-being of dwellers. Simultaneously, the model engages a learning process, through which the classification of the suitability of each apartment is refined through ‘the wisdom of the crowd’, collected through an open web-simulation. This automated design model, regarding both perceptual and physical needs, demonstrates its potential for future use in the development of larger-scale densified urban environments. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Wheat is one of the main grain species as well as one of the most important crops, being the basic food ingredient of people and livestock. Due to the importance of wheat production scale, it is advisable to predict its yield before harvesting. However, the current models are built solely on the basis of quantitative data. Therefore, the aim of the work was to create three multicriteria models for the prediction and simulation of winter wheat yield, which were made on the basis of extended quantitative and qualitative variables from field research in the year period 2008-2015. Neural networks with MLP (multi-layer perceptron) topology were used to build the following models, which can predict and simulate the yield on three dates: 15 April, 31 May, and 30 June. For this reason, they were designated as follows: QQWW15_4, QQWW31_5, and QQWW30_6. Each model is based on a different number of independent features, which ranges from 19 to 25. As a result of the conducted analyses, a MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) forecast error from 6.63% to 6.92% was achieved. This is equivalent of an error ranging from 0.521 to 0.547 t·ha-1, with an average yield of 6.57 ton per hectare of cultivated area. In addition, the most important quantitative and qualitative factors influencing the yield were also indicated. In the first predictive range (15 April), it is the average air temperature from 1 September to 31 December of the previous year (T9-12_PY). In the second predictive range (31 May) it is the sum of precipitation from 1 May to 31 May, and in the third (30 June) is the average air temperature from 1 January to 15 April of the year (T1-4_CY). In addition, one of the qualitative factors had a significant impact on the yield in the first phase-the type of forecrop in the previous year (TF_PY). The presented neural modeling method is a specific extension of the previously used predicting methods. An element of innovation of the presented concept of yield modeling is the possibility of performing a simulation before harvest, in the current agrotechnical season. The presented models can be used in large-area agriculture, especially in precision agriculture as an important element of decision-making support systems. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Agricultural land suitability analysis (ALSA) for crop production is one of the key tools for ensuring sustainable agriculture and for attaining the current global food security goal in line with the Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs) of United Nations. Although some review studies addressed land suitability, few of them specifically focused on land suitability analysis for agriculture. Furthermore, previous reviews have not reflected on the impact of climate change on future land suitability and how this can be addressed or integrated into ALSA methods. In the context of global environmental changes and sustainable agriculture debate, we showed from the current review that ALSA is a worldwide land use planning approach. We reported from the reviewed articles 69 frequently used factors in ALSA. These factors were further categorized in climatic conditions (16), nutrients and favorable soils (34 of soil and landscape), water availability in the root zone (8 for hydrology and irrigation) and socio-economic and technical requirements (11). Also, in getting a complete view of crop's ecosystems and factors that can explain and improve yield, inherent local socio-economic factors should be considered. We showed that this aspect has been often omitted in most of the ALSA modeling with only 38% of the total reviewed article using socio-economic factors. Also, only 30% of the studies included uncertainty and sensitivity analysis in their modeling process. We found limited inclusions of climate change in the application of the ALSA. We emphasize that incorporating current and future climate change projections in ALSA is the way forward for sustainable or optimum agriculture and food security. To this end, qualitative and quantitative approaches must be integrated into a unique ALSA system (Hybrid Land Evaluation System - HLES) to improve the land evaluation approach. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Floods around the world are having devastating effects on human life and property. In this paper, three Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) analysis techniques (VIKOR, TOPSIS and SAW), along with two machine learning methods (NBT and NB), were tested for their ability to model flood susceptibility in one of China's most flood-prone areas, the Ningdu Catchment. Twelve flood conditioning factors were used as input parameters: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), lithology, land use, distance from river, curvature, altitude, Stream Transport Index (STI), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), Stream Power Index (SPI), soil type, slope and rainfall. The predictive capacity of the models was evaluated and validated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC). While all models showed a strong flood prediction capability (AUC > 0.95), the NBT model performed best (AUC = 0.98), suggesting that, among the models studied, the NBT model is a promising tool for the assessment of flood-prone areas and can allow for proper planning and management of flood hazards. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In this paper we present an algorithm designed to train a multi-criteria decision system. This kind of system is very important and used a lot in different military fields and, particularly in cyber-defense. We developed this algorithm to be used with different multi-agent detection systems. The MASFAD system is a typical example [1]. It is a multi-agent system for Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) detection. In this paper we compare different optimization methods for learning Weighted Ordered Weighted Averaging (WOWA) coefficients in order to perform a binary classification. The WOWA function is an aggregation function that is a generalization of OrderedWeighted Averaging (OWA) and the Weighted mean. The WOWA operator combines both of their advantages The learning part is based on a Genetic Algorithm and uses a training dataset. We perform a complete parameter study and we determine the efficiency of our model by evaluating the performance during the classification of different PHP files as webshells or normal files. These PHP files were previously analyzed by a program developed at the Royal Military Academy. We obtain very accurate results and a good stability during the decision process. This system could be used in a lot of different fields. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Evolutionary algorithms are widely used for solving multiobjective optimization problems but are often criticized because of a large number of function evaluations needed. Approximations, especially function approximations, also referred to as surrogates or metamodels are commonly used in the literature to reduce the computation time. This paper presents a survey of 45 different recent algorithms proposed in the literature between 2008 and 2016 to handle computationally expensive multiobjective optimization problems. Several algorithms are discussed based on what kind of an approximation such as problem, function or fitness approximation they use. Most emphasis is given to function approximation-based algorithms. We also compare these algorithms based on different criteria such as metamodeling technique and evolutionary algorithm used, type and dimensions of the problem solved, handling constraints, training time and the type of evolution control. Furthermore, we identify and discuss some promising elements and major issues among algorithms in the literature related to using an approximation and numerical settings used. In addition, we discuss selecting an algorithm to solve a given computationally expensive multiobjective optimization problem based on the dimensions in both objective and decision spaces and the computation budget available. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

A total of 445 landslides were randomly classified into 70% (311 landslides) and 30% (134 landslides) to train and validate landslide models, respectively. Fourteen landslide conditioning factors including slope angle, slope aspect, altitude, topographic wetness index, stream power index, sediment transport index, soil, lithology, NDVI, land use, rainfall, distance to road, distance to river and distance to fault were then studied for landslide susceptibility assessment. Performances of five studied models were evaluated using area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for training (success rate curve) and validation (prediction rate curve) datasets, statistical-based measures and tests. Results indicated that the area under the success rate curve for the FR, IOE, WLC, SVM and SMCE models was 88.32%, 82.58%, 78.91%, 85.47% and 89.96%, respectively, demonstrating that SMCE could provide the higher accuracy. The prediction capability findings revealed that the SMCE model (AUC = 86.81%) was also the highest approach among the five studied models, followed by the FR (AUC = 84.53%), the SVM (AUC = 81.24%), the IOE (AUC = 79.67%) and WLC (73.92%) methods. The landslide susceptibility maps derived from the above five models are reasonably accurate and could be used to perform elementary land use planning for hazard extenuation. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={An interactive decision support framework is presented that assists lab researchers in finding optimal product recipes. Within this framework, an approach for sequential experimental design for black box models in a multicriteria optimization context is introduced. An additional criterion involving the prediction error to design new experiments is used with the goal to get a reliable estimate of the Pareto frontier within a few experimental iterations. The resulting decision support approach accompanies the chemist through the whole workflow and supports the user via interactive, graphical elements. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={A new evolutionary-learning algorithm is proposed to learn a decision maker (DM)'s best solution on a conflicting multiobjective space. Given the exemplary pairwise comparisons of solutions by a DM, we learn an ideal point (for the DM) that is used to evolve toward a better set of solutions. The process is repeated to get the DM's best solution. The comparison of solutions in pairs facilitates the process of eliciting training information for the proposed learning model. Experimental study on standard multiobjective data sets shows that the proposed method accurately identifies a DM's preferred zone in relatively a few generations and with a small number of preferences. Besides, it is found to be robust to inconsistencies in the preference statements. The results obtained are validated through a variant of the established NSGA-2 algorithm. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Many regions in arid and semi-arid lands suffer from water resource scarcity due to climatic constraints combined with a rapid increase in domestic water consumption due to population and industry growth. The increased demand for high-quality and sustainable water assets creates an urgent need to investigate groundwater resources as an alternative solution. In this study, weighted overlay analysis based on an analytical hierarchy process and supported by a random forest machine learning technique was utilized to explore groundwater potential zones in the northern United Arab Emirates (UAE). Toward that end, eight thematic layers were prepared and processed in a geographic information science environment to produce the groundwater potential map (GPM): elevation, slope, precipitation, geology, geomorphology, drainage stream density, major fracture, and lineament density. The resultant GPM was classified in five potential groundwater zones ranging from very high to very low. The GPM was validated based on existing well distribution and selected wellfield yielding production. It was found that 81.7% of existing wells are located in the moderate-high zone and higher. Single-parameter sensitivity analysis technique revealed that the geology, precipitation, and geomorphology were the most significant factors, with a mean effective weight of 42.7%, 34.22%, and 32.23%, respectively. This research provides substantial insights for local water managers and authorities by providing a GPM as well as geo-hydrological findings in order to achieve sustainable groundwater management in the UAE. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The development of credit risk assessment models in the context of credit scoring and rating, is a data-intensive task that involves a considerable level of sophistication in terms of data preparation, analysis, and modeling. From a data analytics perspective, the construction of credit scoring and rating models can be considered as a classification task, that requires the development of models differentiating the borrowers by their level of credit risk. The model fitting process can be implemented with various methodological approaches, based on different types of models, model fitting criteria, and estimation procedures. This chapter presents an overview of different analytical modeling techniques from various fields, such as statistical models (naïve Bayes classifier, discriminant analysis, logistic regression), machine learning (classification trees, neural networks, ensembles), and multicriteria decision aid (value function models and outranking models). Moreover, performance measurement issues are discussed, focusing on the presentation of various popular metrics for evaluating the predictive power and information value of credit scoring and rating models. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This chapter illustrates the application of analytical predictive and descriptive techniques for credit risk assessment. To this end, two case applications are presented using data sets involving corporate defaults and credit card loans. The first part is devoted to the prediction of corporate defaults. A data set of 13,414 European small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises (SMEs) from six countries is considered during the period 2009–2011. The information available for the firms involves their financial characteristics. Corporate default prediction models are constructed with statistical, machine learning, and multicriteria decision making techniques. The analysis of the results covers both the predictive performance of the models, as well as the insights that they provide regarding the factors that affect the default risk for European SMEs. In the second part, a descriptive multivariate clustering approach is employed to obtain analyze credit card loan applications. A publicly available data set of 30,000 cases is analyzed with the k-medoids algorithm to identify clusters of borrowers having similar characteristics. The results are discussed in terms of the common features of the clusters and their level of credit risk. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The paper deals with the reconstruction of implicitly defined functions or digital images. Functions are defined using observations, each of which is the result of a pairwise comparison of the function values for two random arguments. The analysis of the current state of research for particular statements of this problem is presented: the method of pairwise comparisons used in decision-making for a finite set of alternatives; reconstruction of preference/utility function in multicriteria tasks; sign representations of images used for the description and analysis of digital images. A unified approach to reconstructing functions and images according to their sign representations is proposed, based on mapping in a high-dimensional space and constructing a linear (when reconstructing a function and images) or non-linear (including non-parametric) classifier (when reconstructing preferences). For a number of classification algorithms, experimental studies have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using the example of the reconstruction of the utility function in problems of decision theory and reconstruction of the brightness function of real images. © 2019, Institution of Russian Academy of Sciences.

abstract={Treatment planning is an essential step of the radiotherapy workflow. It has become more sophisticated over the past couple of decades with the help of computer science, enabling planners to design highly complex radiotherapy plans to minimize the normal tissue damage while persevering sufficient tumor control. As a result, treatment planning has become more labor intensive, requiring hours or even days of planner effort to optimize an individual patient case in a trial-and-error fashion. More recently, artificial intelligence has been utilized to automate and improve various aspects of medical science. For radiotherapy treatment planning, many algorithms have been developed to better support planners. These algorithms focus on automating the planning process and/or optimizing dosimetric trade-offs, and they have already made great impact on improving treatment planning efficiency and plan quality consistency. In this review, the smart planning tools in current clinical use are summarized in 3 main categories: automated rule implementation and reasoning, modeling of prior knowledge in clinical practice, and multicriteria optimization. Novel artificial intelligence-based treatment planning applications, such as deep learning-based algorithms and emerging research directions, are also reviewed. Finally, the challenges of artificial intelligence-based treatment planning are discussed for future works.},

abstract={Preferences provide a means for specifying the desires of a decision maker (DM) in a declarative way. In this paper, based on a DM’s pairwise preferences, we infer the DM’s unique decision model. We capture (a) the attitudinal character, (b) relative criteria importance, and (c) the criteria interaction, all of which are specific to the DM. We make use of the preference-learning (PL) technique to induce predictive preference models from empirical data. Because PL is emerging as a new subfield of machine learning, we could use standard machine-learning methods to accomplish our learning objective. We consider the DM’s exemplary preference information in the form of pairwise comparisons between alternatives as the training information. The DM’s decision model is captured in terms of (a), (b), and (c), through the parameters of an attitudinal Choquet integral operator. The proposed learning approach is validated through an experimental study on 16 standard data sets. The superiority of the proposed method in terms of predictive accuracy and easier interpretability is shown both theoretically as well as empirically. Copyright: © 2019 INFORMS.},

abstract={In the last few years Parkinson’s Disease (PD) getting lot of attention due to increase in the old age population all over the world. Gait Analysis appeared to be most important tool to study the characteristics of PD. With the advent of low cost wearable sensors as well as powerful machine learning technique lot of researchers finding the method feasible for early detection of PD. Since the collected datasets contains many features, it is necessary to implement the feature selection methods to reduce the computational time as well as to compare the performance of the classifiers with the selected features. In this paper wearable sensors are used for collecting the accelerometer data of 50 patients suffered with Parkinson’s disease inside our University hospital. The datasets were further preprocessed for modelling and then various feature selection algorithm and machine learning techniques are applied to measure the performances such as accuracy, precision and recall, and finally multi criteria decision method named “The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is applied to perform the comparison analysis. This modelling-based approach will help to find the best suitable feature selection techniques as well as provide good accuracy with less possible time. This will help the clinicians to find suitable patterns for early diagnosis of PD. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Classification algorithms are widely used as data mining tools for knowledge extraction. The literature presents several classifiers, but none of them applies to all problems. encountered in the various context in which they are used. Faced with this situation, the present article proposes a multicriteria approach to help practitioners to select the classifiers that will generate the best quality results by observing their performance measures. An empirical study was performed using a baseline of fetal examination from an UCI database using five classification algorithms (C4.5, Naive Bayes, SMO, KNN and Bayesnet), and each classifier was measured using five performance indicators (accuracy, true positive rate, precision, ROC curve and f-measure). Once implemented, a classifier ranking was conducted based on MCDA PROMETHEE II method, and the results show that SMO, C4.5 and Naive Bayes achieved the highest overall ranking. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Treatment planning for protons and heavier ions is adapting technologies originally developed for photon dose optimization, but also has to meet its particular challenges. Since the quality of the applied dose is more sensitive to geometric uncertainties, treatment plan robust optimization has a much more prominent role in particle therapy. This has led to specific planning tools, approaches, and research into new formulations of the robust optimization problems. Tools for solution space navigation and automatic planning are also being adapted to particle therapy. These challenges become even greater when detailed models of relative biological effectiveness (RBE) are included into dose optimization, as is required for heavier ions. © 2018 American Association of Physicists in Medicine},

abstract={Rice is an important cereal crop, being a staple food for over half of the world's population, and sexual reproduction resulting in grain formation underpins global food security. However, despite considerable research efforts, many of the genes, especially long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) genes, involved in sexual reproduction in rice remain uncharacterized. With an increasing number of public resources becoming available, information from different sources can be combined to perform gene functional annotation. We report the development of MCRiceRepGP, a machine learning framework which integrates heterogeneous evidence and employs multicriteria decision analysis and machine learning to predict coding and lincRNA genes involved in sexual reproduction in rice. The rice genome was reannotated using deep-sequencing transcriptomic data from reproduction-associated tissue/cell types identifying previously unannotated putative protein-coding genes and lincRNAs. MCRiceRepGP was used for genome-wide discovery of sexual reproduction associated coding and lincRNA genes. The protein-coding and lincRNA genes identified have distinct expression profiles, with a large proportion of lincRNAs reaching maximum expression levels in the sperm cells. Some of the genes are potentially linked to male- and female-specific fertility and heat stress tolerance during the reproductive stage. MCRiceRepGP can be used in combination with other genome-wide studies, such as genome-wide association studies, giving greater confidence that the genes identified are associated with the biological process of interest. As more data, especially about mutant plant phenotypes, become available, the power of MCRiceRepGP will grow, providing researchers with a tool to identify candidate genes for future experiments. MCRiceRepGP is available as a web application (http://mcgplannotator.com/MCRiceRepGP/). © 2018 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

Taking all influences into account, a standardized multi-criteria optimization problem combining economic suitability, residential burden and site suitability calculates the regional distribution of wind turbines as input for further assessments. By considering the political framework as boundary conditions for the optimization and detailed geographic area suitability factors using a machine learning approach as input parameters, it is possible to assess effects of regulatory restrictions on regional developments. We use a backtesting for validation and weighting of the objectives. Sensitivities of changing regulatory frameworks modeled as different boundary conditions show effects of changing political decisions. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Indoor positioning system is an active research area. There are various performance metrics such as accuracy, computation time, precision, and f-score in machine learning based indoor positioning systems. The aim of this study is to present a multi-criteria decision strategy to determine suitable machine learning methods for a specific indoor positioning system. This helps to evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms considering multiple criteria. During the experiments, UJIIndoorLoc, KIOS and RFKON datasets are used from the positioning literature. The algorithms such as k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, decision tree, naïve bayes and bayesian networks are compared using these datasets. In addition to these, ensemble learning algorithms, namely adaboost and bagging, are utilized to improve the performance of these classifiers. As a conclusion, the test results for any specific dataset are reevaluated using the performance metrics such as accuracy, f-score and computation time, and a multi-criteria decision strategy is proposed to find the most convenient algorithm. The analytical hierarchy process is used for multi-criteria decision. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to select the proper machine learning algorithm for an indoor positioning system using multi-criteria decision strategy. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={This paper proposes a multicriteria design optimization methodology for permanent magnet (PM) motors used in electric vehicle (EV) applications. In the process, an adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is utilized, coupled with a multiobjective optimization algorithm, as a surrogate model of the electric motor. This allows for the consideration of the full drive cycle and respective efficiency map for every motor design. The prediction error of the ANFIS is minimized by employing appropriate membership functions, initial training data, and an adaptive learning scheme via iterative training. The efficiency map is then implemented in a vehicle dynamic model to compute the total consumed energy over the driving cycle. The optimization profile accounts for total energy efficiency, torque density, and additionally considers complementary design criteria via an a posteriori selection procedure on the resulting Pareto set. The methodology developed is applied to optimize a surface PM motor with concentrated fractional slot winding, mounted on a light EV that competes in fuel economy races. The selected motor design has been validated through measurements on a prototype. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents the interesting observation that by performing fewer of the optimizations available in a standard compiler optimization level such as -O2, while preserving their original ordering, significant savings can be achieved in both execution time and energy consumption. This observation has been validated on two embedded processors, namely the ARM Cortex-M0 and the ARM Cortex-M3, using two different versions of the LLVM compilation framework; v3.8 and v5.0. Experimental evaluation with 71 embedded benchmarks demonstrated performance gains for at least half of the benchmarks for both processors. An average execution time reduction of 2.4% and 5.3% was achieved across all the benchmarks for the Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M3 processors, respectively, with execution time improvements ranging from 1% up to 90% over the -O2. The savings that can be achieved are in the same range as what can be achieved by the state-of-the-art compilation approaches that use iterative compilation or machine learning to select flags or to determine phase orderings that result in more efficient code. In contrast to these time consuming and expensive to apply techniques, our approach only needs to test a limited number of optimization configurations, less than 64, to obtain similar or even better savings. Furthermore, our approach can support multi-criteria optimization as it targets execution time, energy consumption and code size at the same time. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have allowed to enhance the performance of conventional, medical diagnosis procedures in different scenarios. Particularly, in the context of voice pathology detection, the use of machine learning algorithms has proved to be a promising and suitable alternative. This work proposes the implementation of two well known classification algorithms, namely artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM), optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, aimed at classifying voice signals between healthy and pathologic ones. Three different configurations of the Saarbrucken voice database (SVD) are used. The effect of using balanced and unbalanced versions of this dataset is proved as well as the usefulness of the considered optimization algorithm to improve the final performance outcomes. Also, proposed approach is comparable with state-of-the-art methods. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Scene recognition is a significant and challenging problem in the field of computer vision. One of the principal bottlenecks in applying machine learning techniques to scene recognition tasks is the requirement of a large number of labeled training data. However, labeling massive training data manually (especially labeling images and videos) is very expensive in terms of human time and effort. In this paper, we present a novel multicriteria-based active discriminative dictionary learning (M-ADDL) algorithm to reduce the human annotation effort and create a robust scene recognition model. The M-ADDL algorithm possesses three advantages. First, M-ADDL introduces an active learning strategy into the discriminative dictionary learning model so that the performance of discriminative dictionary learning can be improved when the number of labeled samples is small. Second, different from most existing active learning methods that measure either the informativeness or representativeness of unlabeled samples to select useful samples for expanding the training dataset, M-ADDL employs both informativeness and representativeness to query useful unlabeled samples and utilizes the manifold-preserving ability of unlabeled samples as an additional sample selection criterion. Finally, a more effective representativeness criterion is presented based on the reconstruction coefficients of the samples. The experimental results of four standard scene recognition databases demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed M-ADDL algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Many real-world classification systems must comply with a series of inherent restrictions to the problem at hand such as response times, power consumptions or computational costs. This poses a fundamental limitation to traditional performance-driven classifiers and learning algorithms by restraining their applicability in cost-sensitive scenarios. Because of this, fuzzy systems are leveraged to learn cost-conscious multi-stage classifiers through multiobjective optimization to find a set of optimal tradeoffs between accuracy and any related cost. This approach allows find a suitable balance between all objectives regardless of the scenario. Experimental evaluations were done for Sound Environment Classification in modern battery-powered hearing aids by jointly optimising classification accuracy and computational costs. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Cloud computing is the expansion of parallel computing, distributed computing. The technology of cloud computing becomes more and more widely used, and one of the fundamental issues in this cloud environment is related to task scheduling. However, scheduling in Cloud environments represents a difficult issue since it is basically NP-complete. Thus, many variants based on approximation techniques, especially those inspired by Swarm Intelligence (SI) have been proposed. This paper proposes a machine learning algorithm to guide the cloud choose the scheduling technique by using multi criteria decision to optimize the performance. The main contribution of our work is to minimize the makespan of a given task set. The new strategy is simulated using the CloudSim toolkit package where the impact of the algorithm is checked with different numbers of VMs varying from 2 to 50, and different task sizes between 30 bytes and 2700 bytes. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm minimizes the execution time and the makespan between 7% and 75%, and improves the performance of the load balancing scheduling. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The therapeutic effects of drugs are well known to result from their interaction with multiple intracellular targets. Accordingly, the pharma industry is currently moving from a reductionist approach based on a ‘one-target fixation’ to a holistic multitarget approach. However, many drug discovery practices are still procedural abstractions resulting from the attempt to understand and address the action of biologically active compounds while preventing adverse effects. Here, we discuss how drug discovery can benefit from the principles of evolutionary biology and report two real-life case studies. We do so by focusing on the desirability principle, and its many features and applications, such as machine learning-based multicriteria virtual screening. Here, we describe a multicriteria virtual screening approach based on desirability functions and tailored ensemble machine-learning classifiers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In Data Mining, during the preprocessing step, there is a considerable diversity of candidate algorithms to select important features, according to some criteria. This broad availability of algorithms that perform the Feature Selection task gives rise to the difficulty of choosing, a priori, between the algorithms at hand, the most promising one for a particular problem. In this paper, we present the proposal and evaluation of a new architecture for the recommendation of Feature Selection algorithms based on the use of Metalearning. Our framework is very flexible since the user can adapt it to its proper needs. This flexibility is one of the main advantages of our proposal over other approaches in the literature, which involve steps that cannot be adapted to the user's local requirements. Furthermore, it combines several concepts of intelligent systems, including Machine Learning and Data Mining, with topics derived from expert systems, as user and data-driven knowledge, with meta-knowledge. This set of solutions coupled with leading-edge technologies allows our architecture to be integrated into any information system, which impact on the automation of services and in reducing human effort during the process. Regarding the Metalearning process, our framework considers several types of properties inherent to the data sets, as well as, Feature Selection algorithms based on many information, distance, dependence and consistency measures. The quality of the methods for Feature Selection was estimated according to a multicriteria performance measure, which guided the ranking process of these algorithms for the construction of data metabases. Proposed by the authors of this work, this multicriteria performance measure combines any three measurements on a single one, creating an interesting and powerful tool to evaluate not only FS algorithms but also to assess any context where it is necessary a combination to maximize a measure or minimize it. The recommendation models, represented by decision trees and induced from the training metabases, allowed us to see in what circumstances a Feature Selection algorithm outperforms the other and what aspects of the data present greater influence in determining the performance of these algorithms. Nevertheless, if the user wishes, any other learning algorithm may be used to induce the recommendation model. This versatility is another strong point of this proposal. Results show that with the characterization of data, through statistical, information and complexity measures, it is possible to reach an accuracy higher than 90%. Besides yielding recommendation models that are interpretable and robust to overfitting, the developed architecture is less computationally expensive than approaches recently proposed in the literature. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The Social Web is characterized by a massive diffusion of unfiltered content, directly generated by users via the spread of different social media platforms. In this context, a challenging issue is to assess the veracity of the information generated within the sites of online reviews. To address this issue, a common practice in the literature is to select and analyze some veracity features associated with users and their reviews, by mostly applying machine learning techniques, to provide a classification in genuine and deceptive reviews. In this paper, we do not focus on the feature selection and user behavior analysis issues, but we concentrate on the aggregation process with respect to each single veracity feature. In most of the approaches based on machine learning techniques, the contribution of each feature in the classification process is not measurable by the user. For this reason, we propose a multicriteria decision making approach based both on the assessment of multiple criteria and the use of aggregation operators with the aim of obtaining a veracity score associated with each review. Based on this score, it is possible to detect fake reviews. The proposed model is evaluated on a Yelp data set by applying different aggregation schemes, and it is compared with well-known supervised machine learning techniques. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={114Any interruption in the electric service system could lead to major disruption of daily life and economic losses. Therefore, electric utility companies strive to maintain high customer service levels and try to make the best use of past power outage experiences. Increasing capabilities of analytics and improved accuracy of short-term weather forecasts present opportunities for electric utilities to leverage historic data to predict outages and proactively make decisions to minimize interruptions. As discussed in Chapter 3, analytics can be grouped into three types: descriptive analytics, predictive analytics, and prescriptive analytics. Electric utilities typically use descriptive analytics such as Pareto chart for descriptive statistics and data visualization to derive insights about most frequent cause of power interruptions. This chapter mainly focuses on predictive analytics that uses weather forecasts to predict power interruptions. In this chapter, prescriptive analytics is limited to formulating a multiple criteria mathematical programming model that minimizes staffing the cost and duration of power interruption. The objective of this chapter is to predict customer interruptions using historical data and hourly weather forecasts. Six different machine learning algorithms are evaluated and the best algorithm is chosen using multiple criteria ranking techniques to predict power interruptions. A case study using data of an electric utility covering 75 substations consisting of 19 fields and over 40,000 records collected over a 1-year period is used to illustrate the proposed methodology. Further, to illustrate the advantages of the prediction model, the prediction outputs are used as a key parameter to formulate a multicriteria mathematical programming model for workforce planning. © 2017 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={176Large risks associated with the approval of bad loans has forced financial institutions such as banks to carefully choose their customers. In this chapter, a two-stage decision support system is developed to enable banks in establishing an efficient loan portfolio that incorporates their strategic goals. Classification of customers into two levels of credit risk (high risk or low risk) is addressed in the first stage. Five different machine learning techniques (logistic regression, random forests, neural networks, gradient boosting, and stacking) are developed to classify the customers, and the best technique is selected using different performance measures such as sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. In the second stage, a multicriteria mathematical programming model is developed to obtain a diversified loan portfolio with the objective of achieving higher returns and lower risk. The functionality and applicability of the two-stage decision support system are shown using real-world data. © 2017 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Background: As the Internet becomes the number one destination for obtaining health-related information, there is an increasing need to identify health Web pages that convey an accurate and current view of medical knowledge. In response, the research community has created multicriteria instruments for reliably assessing online medical information quality. One such instrument is DISCERN, which measures health Web page quality by assessing an array of features. In order to scale up use of the instrument, there is interest in automating the quality evaluation process by building machine learning (ML)-based DISCERN Web page classiﬁers. Objective: The paper addresses 2 key issues that are essential before constructing automated DISCERN classiﬁers: (1) generation of a robust DISCERN training corpus useful for training classiﬁcation algorithms, and (2) assessment of the usefulness of the current DISCERN scoring schema as a metric for evaluating the performance of these algorithms. Methods: Using DISCERN, 272 Web pages discussing treatment options in breast cancer, arthritis, and depression were evaluated and rated by trained coders. First, different consensus models were compared to obtain a robust aggregated rating among the coders, suitable for a DISCERN ML training corpus. Second, a new DIS-CERN scoring criterion was proposed (features-based score) as an ML performance metric that is more reﬂective of the score distribution across different DISCERN quality criteria. Results: First, we found that a probabilistic consensus model applied to the DISCERN instrument was robust against noise (random ratings) and superior to other approaches for building a training corpus. Second, we found that the established DISCERN scoring schema (overall score) is ill-suited to measure ML performance for automated classiﬁers. Conclusion: Use of a probabilistic consensus model is advantageous for building a training corpus for the DISCERN instrument, and use of a features-based score is an appropriate ML metric for automated DISCERN classiﬁers. © The Author 2016.},

abstract={Complexity in solving real-world multicriteria optimization problems often stems from the fact that complex, expensive, and/or time-consuming simulation tools or physical experiments are used to evaluate solutions to a problem. In such settings, it is common to use efficient computational models, often known as surrogates or metamodels, to approximate the outcome (objective or constraint function value) of a simulation or physical experiment. The presence of multiple objective functions poses an additional layer of complexity for surrogate-assisted optimization. For example, complexities may relate to the appropriate selection of metamodels for the individual objective functions, extensive training time of surrogate models, or the optimal use of many-core computers to approximate efficiently multiple objectives simultaneously. Thinking out of the box, complexity can also be shifted from approximating the individual objective functions to approximating the entire Pareto front. This leads to further complexities, namely, how to validate statistically and apply the techniques developed to real-world problems. In this paper, we discuss emerging complexity-related topics in surrogate-assisted multicriteria optimization that may not be prevalent in nonsurrogate-assisted single-objective optimization. These complexities are motivated using several real-world problems in which the authors were involved. We then discuss several promising future research directions and prospective solutions to tackle emerging complexities in surrogate-assisted multicriteria optimization. Finally, we provide insights from an industrial point of view into how surrogate-assisted multicriteria optimization techniques can be developed and applied within a collaborative business environment to tackle real-world problems.

abstract={Terrain conditions, stand structure attributes, and environmental factors are important elements that determine the success of timber harvests. Planning designs for timber harvesting projects must also be physically feasible, environmentally acceptable, and economically viable and address potentially competing objectives upfront in a multi-purpose planning effort. Under mountainous conditions involving highly variable and steep terrain, harvest planning is a particularly complex decision-making process. Here, quantitative (objective) information (e.g., stand volume) is jointly considered with qualitative (subjective) information (e.g., expert judgment of slope failure event and preference value of a certain stand) to arrive at a compromise plan that considers conflicting management objectives. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the existing terrain conditions of a large management area to find zones in which harvest operations can be conducted, assess which portions of the terrain can be harvested by different equipment that is available in the region, and locate landing sites for ground-based skidding operations. The criteria used in this study included quantitative and qualitative elements that were measured/evaluated across different scales. To address this complex decision-making process, we used an integrative approach that combined spatial analyses with multiple-criteria decision analysis (SMCDA). Existing geospatial data were combined with information obtained through pairwise evaluations of environmental, topographic, and stand structure elements to create maps in which the terrain was divided into zones of different suitability classes for timber harvests, placement of landing sites, and deployment of different harvesting systems. The results and assessment of this case study indicate that the methodology has great potential for a more integrated policy, in particular, where multiple spatial objectives explicitly need to be taken into consideration when solving complex forest-management problems in mountainous conditions. One key finding from this work that needs to be further explored involves efficient ways of incorporating this methodology into traditional harvest scheduling models to better support the operational and tactical phases of the timber harvesting. © 2016},

abstract={Opportunistic networking is at the basis of cyber-physical Mobile Networks in Proximity (MNP), through its unique perspective over mobility and the incorporation of socio-inspired networking algorithms. However, results in the field are mostly theoretical, proven to account for stricter hit rate and latency requirements in specific environments. They generally assume that two devices being in proximity automatically see one-another, an assumption which might not stand under real-world conditions (Bluetooth assumes a peering session and close-proximity, WiFi Direct implementations are different between manufacturers, etc.). Our previous studies in the area show that WiFi is still the most feasible media for opportunistic contacts. WiFi-enabled devices, with out-of-the-box networking capabilities, can connect in an ad-hoc opportunistic network, over wireless routers, and thus support a cyber-physical infrastructure for opportunistically spreading information. In this article, we propose a machine learning algorithm that aims to increase the number of contacts between mobile nodes by using a smarter WiFi access point selection heuristic. The algorithm is based on properly balancing signal strength, latency, bandwidth, and, most importantly, the number of friends predicted to connect to the respective access point. We show through simulations based on real-life tracing data-sets that our proposed solution not only increases the likelihood of opportunistic contacts, but it also evenly distributes social subgraphs of users over wireless networks while improving the overall hit rate. © 2016},

abstract={Several global gross primary production (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) remote sensing products exist, mainly provided by machine-learning (e.g. MPI-BGC) and semi-empirical (e.g. MODIS) approaches. Process-based approaches have the advantage of representing the atmosphere-vegetation-soil system and associated fluxes as an organic integration, but their sophistication results in a lack of high spatiotemporal resolution continuous products. Targeting this gap, we reported a new set of global 8-day composite 1-km resolution GPP and ET products from 2000 to 2015, using a simplified process-based model, the Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS). BESS couples atmosphere and canopy radiative transfer, photosynthesis and evapotranspiration, and uses MODIS atmosphere and land data and other satellite data sources as inputs. We evaluated BESS products against FLUXNET observations at site scale (total of 113 sites, 742 site years), and against MPI-BGC products at global scale. At site scale, BESS 8-day products agreed with FLUXNET observations with R2 = 0.67 and RMSE = 2.58 gC m− 2 d− 1 for GPP, and R2 = 0.62 and RMSE = 0.78 mm d− 1 for ET, respectively, and they captured a majority of seasonal variability, about half of spatial variability, and a minority of interannual variability in FLUXNET observations. At global scale, BESS mean annual sum GPP and ET maps agreed with MPI-BGC products with R2 = 0.93 and RMSE = 229 gC m− 2 y− 1 for GPP, and R2 = 0.90 and RMSE = 118 mm y− 1 for ET, respectively. Over the period of 2001–2011, BESS quantified the mean global GPP and ET as 122 ± 25 PgC y− 1 and 65 × 103 ± 11 × 103 km3 y− 1, respectively, with a significant ascending GPP trend by 0.27 PgC y− 2 (p &lt; 0.05), similar to MPI-BGC products as well. Overall, BESS GPP and ET estimates were comparable with FLUXNET observations and MPI-BGC products. The process-based BESS can serve as a set of independent GPP and ET products from official MODIS GPP and ET products. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and detection error tradeoff (DET) curves are frequently used in the machine learning community to analyze the performance of binary classifiers. Recently, the convex-hull-based multiobjective genetic programming algorithm was proposed and successfully applied to maximize the convex hull area for binary classification problems by minimizing false positive rate and maximizing true positive rate at the same time using indicator-based evolutionary algorithms. The area under the ROC curve was used for the performance assessment and to guide the search. Here we extend this research and propose two major advancements: Firstly we formulate the algorithm in detection error tradeoff space, minimizing false positives and false negatives, with the advantage that misclassification cost tradeoff can be assessed directly. Secondly, we add complexity as an objective function, which gives rise to a 3D objective space (as opposed to a 2D previous ROC space). A domain specific performance indicator for 3D Pareto front approximations, the volume above DET surface, is introduced, and used to guide the indicator-based evolutionary algorithm to find optimal approximation sets. We assess the performance of the new algorithm on designed theoretical problems with different geometries of Pareto fronts and DET surfaces, and two application-oriented benchmarks: (1) Designing spam filters with low numbers of false rejects, false accepts, and low computational cost using rule ensembles, and (2) finding sparse neural networks for binary classification of test data from the UCI machine learning benchmark. The results show a high performance of the new algorithm as compared to conventional methods for multicriteria optimization. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Traditional units of genome-wide association studies have serious defects such as low repeatability, difficulty to interpret, and epistasis analysis based on machine learning has troubles such as high computational complexity and insufficient prediction accuracy. This paper presented a new approach for the analysis of genome-wide epistatic. This method uses the framework of two-phase epistatic analysis method. It includes a filtering stage and an epistatic combinatorial optimization stage. The characteristics of the filtering stage presents a multicriteria fusion strategy for the evaluation of genetic loci from multiple perspectives to ensure that the weak effect of susceptibility loci can be retained, and then, this method uses the multiple criteria sorting fusion strategy to eliminate the low degree of genetic variation associated with disease states. Epistatic combinatorial optimization phase uses the greedy algorithm combination of heuristic search space in order to reduce the time complexity. Finally, a support vector machine was used as the epistatic evaluation model. Experiments with different parameters of linkage disequilibrium SNPruler with classical algorithms were compared with the performance of the ACO, and the experiment results show that the method can effectively keep weak effect locus and improve disease forecasting accuracy considerably. © 2016, Editorial Department of Journal of Hunan University.

abstract={This paper proposes a novel multicriteria decision making (MCDM) method using the TOPSIS method and similarity measures between intuitionistic fuzzy values. First, it calculates the degree of indeterminacy (DOI) of each evaluating intuitionistic fuzzy value (IFV) given by the decision maker. Then, it calculates the DOI of the relative positive ideal value (RPIV) and the relative negative ideal value (RNIV) for each criterion, respectively. Then, it calculates the positive similarity degrees and the negative similarity degrees. Finally, it calculates the weighted positive score and the weighted negative score of each alternative, respectively, to get the relative degree of closeness of each alternative. The advantage of the proposed MCDM method is that it can overcome the drawbacks of the existing MCDM methods for MCDM in intuitionistic fuzzy environments. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={We describe a "multistep reaction driven" evolutionary algorithm approach to de novo molecular design. Structures generated by the approach include a proposed synthesis path intended to aid the chemist in assessing the synthetic feasibility of the ideas that are generated. The methodology is independent of how the design ideas are scored, allowing multicriteria drug design to address multiple issues including activity at one or more pharmacological targets, selectivity, physical and ADME properties, and off target liabilities; the methods are compatible with common computer-aided drug discovery "scoring" methodologies such as 2D- and 3D-ligand similarity, docking, desirability functions based on physiochemical properties, and/or predictions from 2D/3D QSAR or machine learning models and combinations thereof to be used to guide design. We have performed experiments to assess the extent to which known drug space can be covered by our approach. Using a library of 88 generic reactions and a database of ∼20 000 reactants, we find that our methods can identify "close" analogs for ∼50% of the known small molecule drugs with molecular weight less than 300. To assess the quality of the in silico generated synthetic pathways, synthesis chemists were asked to rate the viability of synthesis pathways: both "real" and in silico generated. In silico reaction schemes generated by our methods were rated as very plausible with scores similar to known literature synthesis schemes. © 2016 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Assessment of skeletal maturation is important for the accurate diagnosis and medical treatment of many disorders and syndromes. However, determining skeletal maturation is not a trivial task, and requires professional medical training. The aim of this paper is to review the application of classification techniques to the problem of identifying the skeletal maturation stage of individuals, in order to provide the specialists a second opinion to backup or reject their assessments. A methodology based on Rough Sets is developed, which formulates skeletal maturation as a multicriteria classification problem, and generates classification rules employing data from lateral radiographs. Our methodology introduces the concept of transition maturity stages to obtain a finer classification on the data. Our empirical evaluation shows that the rules generated match the terms used by experts to determine maturation stage. Furthermore, our rough sets methodology produces the best results in our case of study, both in terms of coverage on the data and accuracy of the classification process, with respect to alternative classification approaches. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Because of the current shift away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy sources, it is necessary to plan for the installation of new infrastructure to meet the demand for clean energy. Traditional methods for determining wind turbine site suitability suffer from the selection of arbitrary criteria and model parameters by experts, which may lead to a degree of uncertainty in the models produced. An alternative empirically based methodology for building a wind turbine siting model for the state of Iowa is presented in the study. We employ 'ecological niche' principles traditionally utilized to model species allocation to develop a new multicriteria, spatially explicit framework for wind turbine placement. Using information on suitability conditions at existing turbine locations, we incorporate seven variables (wind speed, elevation, slope, land cover, distance of infrastructure and settlements, and population density) into two machine-learning algorithms [maximum entropy method (Maxent) and Genetic Algorithm for Rule Set Prediction (GARP)] to model suitable areas for installation of wind turbines. The performance of this method is tested at the statewide level and a six-county region in western Iowa. Maxent and GARP identified areas in the Northwest and North Central regions of Iowa as the optimum location for new wind turbines. Information on variable contributions from Maxent illuminates the relative importance of environmental variables and its scale-dependent nature. It also allows validating existing assumptions about the relationship between variables and wind turbine suitability. The resultant models demonstrate high levels of accuracy and suggest that the presented approach is a possible methodology for developing wind turbine siting applications.

abstract={Problems that reduce to consistency or inconsistency of systems of linear equations or inequalities arise in many divisions of theoretical informatics. The examples are problems in linear programming, machine learning, multicriteria optimization, etc. There exist different stability measures for the property of consistency or inconsistency, and different information constituents are possible (all the input parameters, the coefficient matrix, the vector of constraints). In this paper, variations of all parameters are examined in combination with an additional constraint important in applications, namely, the nonnegativity of feasible points. © 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

abstract={This study investigates the evaluation of machine learning models based on multiple criteria. The criteria included are: predictive model accuracy, model complexity, and algorithmic complexity (related to the learning/adaptation algorithm and prediction delivery) captured by monitoring the execution time. Furthermore, it compares the models generated from optimising the criteria using two approaches. The first approach is a scalarized multi objective optimisation, where the models are generated from optimising a single cost function that combines the criteria. On the other hand the second approach uses a Pareto-based multi objective optimisation to trade-off the three criteria and to generate a set of non-dominated models. This study shows that defining universal measures for the three criteria is not always feasible. Furthermore, it was shown that, the models generated from Pareto-based multi objective optimisation approach can be more accurate and more diverse than the models generated from scalarized multi objective optimisation approach. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Recent research revealed that model-assisted parameter tuning can improve the quality of supervised machine learning (ML) models. The tuned models were especially found to generalize better and to be more robust compared to other optimization approaches. However, the advantages of the tuning often came along with high computation times, meaning a real burden for employing tuning algorithms. While the training with a reduced number of patterns can be a solution to this, it is often connected with decreasing model accuracies and increasing instabilities and noise. Hence, we propose a novel approach defined by a two criteria optimization task, where both the runtime and the quality of ML models are optimized. Because the budgets for this optimization task are usually very restricted in ML, the surrogate-assisted Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) algorithm is adapted. In order to cope with noisy experiments, we apply two hypervolume indicator based EGO algorithms with smoothing and re-interpolation of the surrogate models. The techniques do not need replicates. We find that these EGO techniques can outperform traditional approaches such as latin hypercube sampling (LHS), as well as EGO variants with replicates. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to present a Total Power Quality Index (TPQI) for estimating Power Quality (PQ) at a specific site of the electric network using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methodology techniques and a variety of methods from Machine Learning. The main advantage of this methodology is the avoidance of certain arbitrary parameters used in previous research efforts implementing a Fuzzy Index Model. For the purposes of this study and for the training process of the proposed ANN model additional data derived from Power Quality measurements along with an appropriate questionnaire which gathered the opinion of experts was used. The proposed methodology appeared to be flexible, reprogrammable with the capability to assimilate new measurements and estimations in any specific case study. The outcome of the proposed ANN model is compared with the corresponding previously introduced Fuzzy Index model over three different case studies, providing significant results for further improvement. © 2015 The Authors.

abstract={Three different approaches for evaluation of the research impact by a scientist are considered. Two of them are conventional ones, scoring the impact over (a) citation metrics and (b) merit metrics. The third one relates to the level of results. It involves a taxonomy of the research field, that is, a hierarchy representing its composition. The impact is evaluated according to the taxonomy ranks of the subjects that have emerged or have been crucially transformed due to the results by the scientist under consideration Mirkin (Control Large Syst Spec Issue 44:292– 307, 2013). To aggregate criteria in approaches (a) and (b) we use an in-house automated criteria weighting method oriented towards as tight a representation of the strata as possible Orlov (Bus Inf, 2014). To compare the approaches empirically, we use publicly available data of about 30 scientists in the areas of data analysis and machine learning. As our taxonomy of the field, we invoke a corresponding part of the ACM Computing Classification System 2012 and slightly modify it to better reflect results by the scientists in our sample. The obtained ABC stratifications are rather far each other. This supports the view that all the three approaches (citations, merits, taxonomic rank) should be considered as different aspects, and, therefore, a good method for scoring research impact should involve all the three. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Network intrusion is recognized as a chronic and recurring problem. Hacking techniques continually change and several countermeasure methods have been suggested in the literature including statistical and machine learning approaches. However, no single solution can be claimed as a rule of thumb for the wide spectrum of attacks. In this paper, a novel methodology is proposed for network intrusion detection based on the multicriteria PROAFTN classification. The algorithm is evaluated and compared on a publicly available and widely used dataset. The results in this paper show that the proposed algorithm is promising in detecting various types of intrusions with high classification accuracy. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Aim: To analyse spatial trade-offs in conservation of mammals, considering benefits of biodiversity conservation and socioeconomic costs. Location: Cerrado Biodiversity Hotspot, Brazil. Methods: We built ecological niche models (ENMs) for 154 mammals inhabiting the cerrado. We combined model projections to produce consensus maps of species' distributions for three types of models (envelope, statistical and machine-learning models). We used these range summaries as input data in spatial prioritization analyses. We compared six conservation scenarios, considering human population density, land cost, anthropogenic land use, political willingness to act and the distribution of species using trade-off analyses. We complemented the current network of protected areas, aiming to achieve a target of 17% of land protection in the cerrado. Results: Species-rich sites coincide with regions with high human population, high land cost, high anthropogenic land use and diverse levels of political willingness to act. We found a significant change in spatial priorities when we included socioeconomic and political dimensions in analyses: top-priority sites moved north, reduced by 68% potential conservation conflicts with human population, reduced by 72% the total monetary cost of actions and reduced by 68% conflict with other anthropogenic land uses. It also increased by 80% the beneficial effect of political willingness to act. Main conclusions: Our results reinforce the idea that using only biological criteria for proposing spatial conservation priorities can undermine conservation plans given increases in socioeconomic and political conflicts. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={In this paper, an approach to decision making is described. It combines a knowledge acquisition technique, a multi-attribute decision making technique, a validation technique and a machine learning algorithm. The suggested system is an extension of a previous decision support system based on the fuzzy repertory table technique. The aim is to increase its efficiency when dealing with a great amount of alternatives and criteria. The solution is based on a mechanism to divide the original problem into several simpler sub-problems. Moreover, a case study is presented to illustrate how the proposed system is used to design a Product Search Assistant. It will be integrated into a multi-agent architecture developed to give support to an e-marketplace. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider the problem of automatically assessing sofware quality. We show that we can look at this problem, called Software Quality Assessment (SQA), as a multicriteria decision-making problem. Indeed, just like software is assessed along different criteria, Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is about decisions that are based on several criteria that are usually conflicting and non-homogenously satisfied. Nonadditive (fuzzy) measures along with the Choquet integral can be used to model and aggregate the levels of satisfaction of these criteria by considering their relationships. However, in practice, fuzzy measures are difficult to identify. An automated process is necessary and possible when sample data is available. Several optimization approaches have been proposed to extract fuzzy measures from sample data; e.g., genetic algorithms, gradient descent algorithms, and the Bees algorithm, all local search techniques. In this article, we propose a hybrid approach, combining the Bees algorithm and an interval constraint solver, resulting in a focused search expected to be less prone to falling into local results. Our approach, when tested on SQA decision data, shows promise and compares well to previous approaches to SQA that were using machine learning techniques. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Determining the number of clusters in a data set is an essential yet difficult step in cluster analysis. Since this task involves more than one criterion, it can be modeled as a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. This paper proposes a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM)-based approach to estimate the number of clusters for a given data set. In this approach, MCDM methods consider different numbers of clusters as alternatives and the outputs of any clustering algorithm on validity measures as criteria. The proposed method is examined by an experimental study using three MCDM methods, the well-known clustering algorithm-k-means, ten relative measures, and fifteen public-domain UCI machine learning data sets. The results show that MCDM methods work fairly well in estimating the number of clusters in the data and outperform the ten relative measures considered in the study. © 2012 Peng et al.},

abstract={The topic of preferences is a new branch of machine learning and data mining, and it has attracted considerable attention in artificial intelligence research in recent years. Representing and processing knowledge in terms of preferences is appealing as it allows one to specify desires in a declarative way, to combine qualitative and quantitative modes of reasoning, and to deal with inconsistencies and exceptions in a flexible manner. Preference learning is concerned with the acquisition of preference models from data it involves learning from observations that reveal information about the preferences of an individual or a class of individuals, and building models that generalize beyond such training data. This is the first book dedicated to this topic, and the treatment is comprehensive. The editors first offer a thorough introduction, including a systematic categorization according to learning task and learning technique, along with a unified notation. The remainder of the book is organized into parts that follow the developed framework, complementing survey articles with in-depth treatises of current research topics in this area. The book will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in artificial intelligence, in particular machine learning and data mining, and in fields such as multicriteria decision-making and operations research. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.},

abstract={The purpose of spatial modelling in animal and public health is three-fold: describing existing spatial patterns of risk, attempting to understand the biological mechanisms that lead to disease occurrence and predicting what will happen in the medium to long-term future (temporal prediction) or in different geographical areas (spatial prediction). Traditional methods for temporal and spatial predictions include general and generalized linear models (GLM), generalized additive models (GAM) and Bayesian estimation methods. However, such models require both disease presence and absence data which are not always easy to obtain. Novel spatial modelling methods such as maximum entropy (MAXENT) and the genetic algorithm for rule set production (GARP) require only disease presence data and have been used extensively in the fields of ecology and conservation, to model species distribution and habitat suitability. Other methods, such as multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), use knowledge of the causal factors of disease occurrence to identify areas potentially suitable for disease. In addition to their less restrictive data requirements, some of these novel methods have been shown to outperform traditional statistical methods in predictive ability (Elith et al., 2006). This review paper provides details of some of these novel methods for mapping disease distribution, highlights their advantages and limitations, and identifies studies which have used the methods to model various aspects of disease distribution. © 2011.},

abstract={Accurate estimation of site productivity is crucial for sustainable forest resource management. In recent years, a variety of modelling approaches have been developed and applied to predict site index from a wide range of environmental variables, with varying success. The selection, application and comparison of suitable modelling techniques remains therefore a meticulous task, subject to ongoing research and debate.In this study, the performance of five modelling techniques was compared for the prediction of forest site index in two contrasting ecoregions: the temperate lowland of Flanders, Belgium, and the Mediterranean mountains in SW Turkey. The modelling techniques include statistical (multiple linear regression - MLR, classification and regression trees - CART, generalized additive models - GAM), as well as machine-learning (artificial neural networks - ANN) and hybrid techniques (boosted regression trees - BRT). Although the selected predictor variables differed largely, with mainly topographic predictor variables in the mountain area versus soil and humus variables in the lowland area, the techniques performed comparatively similar in both ecoregions.Stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis (SMAA) was found a well-suited multicriteria evaluation method to evaluate the performance of the modelling techniques. It has been applied on the individual species models of Flanders, as well as a species-independent evaluation, combining all developed models from the two contrasting ecoregions. We came to the conclusion that non-parametric models are better suited for predicting site index than traditional MLR. GAM and BRT are the preferred alternatives for a wide range of weight preferences. CART is preferred when very high weight is given to user-friendliness, whereas ANN is recommended when most weight is given to pure predictive performance. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The objectives of this paper are (1) to propose new techniques to learn and improve the multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) method PROAFTN based on machine learning approaches and (2) to compare the performance of the developed methods with other well-known machine learning classification algorithms. The proposed learning methods consist of two stages: The first stage involves using the discretization techniques to obtain the required parameters for the PROAFTN method, and the second stage is the development of a new inductive approach to construct PROAFTN prototypes for classification. The comparative study is based on the generated classification accuracy of the algorithms on the data sets. For further robust analysis of the experiments, we used the Friedman statistical measure with the corresponding post hoc tests. The proposed approaches significantly improved the performance of the classification method PROAFTN. Based on the generated results on the same data sets, PROAFTN outperforms widely used classification algorithms. Furthermore, the method is simple, no preprocessing is required, and no loss of information during learning. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Disaggregation methods have become popular in multicriteria decision aiding (MCDA) for eliciting preferential information and constructing decision models from decision examples. From a statistical point of view, data mining and machine learning are also involved with similar problems, mainly with regard to identifying patterns and extracting knowledge from data. Recent research has also focused on the introduction of specific domain knowledge in machine learning algorithms. Thus, the connections between disaggregation methods in MCDA and traditional machine learning tools are becoming stronger. In this paper the relationships between the two fields are explored. The differences and similarities between the two approaches are identified, and a review is given regarding the integration of the two fields. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Finding optimal routes for packet delivery in a WSN is presented as a multicriteria optimization problem termed Dyna-Routing. Delay in delivering packets to sinks, energy used for transmitting packets, rate of energy depletion in respective nodes and also, properties of the transmission medium are used to form metrics for evaluating routing options. A Dyna Reinforcement Learning algorithm suitable for non deterministic environments is used to speed up learning such that minimal energy is wasted on suboptimal action choices. Simulation results of Dyna-Routing compared to other machine learning routing approaches show a marked increase in the lifespan of nodes and the network in general. ©2010 Old City Publishing, Inc.},

abstract={Today, emerging and increasing resistance to antibiotics has become a threat to public health worldwide. Antimicrobial peptides have unique action mechanisms making them an attractive therapeutic prospect to be applied against resistant bacteria. However, the major drawback is related with their high hemolytic activity which cancels out the safety requirements for a human antibiotic. Therefore, additional efforts are needed to develop new antimicrobial peptides that possess a greater potency for bacterial cells and less or no toxicity over erythrocytes. In this paper, we introduce a practical approach to simultaneously deal with these two conflicting properties. The convergence of machine learning techniques and desirability theory allowed us to derive a simple, predictive, and interpretable multicriteria classification rule for simultaneously handling the antibacterial and hemolytic properties of a set of cyclic β-hairpin cationic peptidomimetics (Cβ-HCPs). The multicriteria classification rule exhibited a prediction accuracy of about 80% on training and external validation sets. Results from an additional concordance test have shown an excellent agreement between the multicriteria classification rule predictions and the predictions from independent classifiers for complementary antibacterial and hemolytic activities, respectively, evidencing the reliability of the multicriteria classification rule. The rule was also consistent with the general mode of action of cationic peptides pointing out its biophysical relevance. We also propose a multicriteria virtual screening strategy based on the joint use of the multicriteria classification rule, desirability, similarity, and chemometrics concepts. The ability of such a virtual screening strategy to prioritize selective (nonhemolytic) antibacterial Cβ-HCPs was assessed and challenged for their predictivity regarding the training, validation, and overall data. In doing so, we were able to rank a selective antibacterial Cβ-HCP earlier than a biologically inactive or nonselective antibacterial Cβ-HCP with a probability of ca. 0.9. Our results thus indicate that promising chemoinformatics tools were obtained by considering both the multicriteria classification rule and the virtual screening strategy, which could, for instance, be used to aid the discovery and development of potent and nontoxic antimicrobial peptides. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={We present an integrated methodology composed of a role-playing game on land adjudication from which we extract narrative and spatially explicit drivers of land-use decisions. We show how geographic information systems (GIS), qualitative decision-matrix analyses, a simple rule-based model using multi-criteria evaluations (MCE), and a machine learning-based land-transformation model (LTM) can be used harmoniously to study complex socio-ecological systems. We evaluate how each technique performs in the study of complex socio-ecological systems using a multi-tier framework detailing how each method analyzes the resource system, resource units, governance system, users and interactions and outcomes in the system. We show that each approach enhances our understanding of the land-use decision making process. Each method provides various information on the drivers of land-use decision, some focusing more on spatial components of socio-ecological systems (resource system and resource unit) and other having a strong emphasis on social mechanisms (governance system, users, interactions and outcomes). Furthermore, we shed light into the existence of a flow of information between the various methods enhancing our understanding of land-use drivers. We end with a discussion on methodological tradeoffs between models and the value of our more holistic approach to modeling land-use drivers and decisions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Genetic fuzzy systems (GFS) are based on the use of genetic algorithms for designing fuzzy systems, and for providing them with learning and adaptation capabilities. In this context, fuzzy sets represent linguistic granules of information, contained in the antecedents and consequents of the rules, whereas the data used in the genetic learning is assumed to be crisp. GFS seldom deal with fuzzy-valued data. In this paper we address this problem, and propose a set of techniques that can be incorporated to different GFS in order to learn a knowledge base (KB) from interval and fuzzy data for regression problems. Details will be given about the representation of non-standard data with fuzzy sets, about the needed changes in the reasoning method of the fuzzy rule-based system, and also about a new generalization of the mean squared error to vague data. In addition, we will show that the learning process requires a genetic algorithm that must be capable of optimizing a multicriteria fitness function, containing both crisp and interval-valued criteria. Lastly, we benchmark our procedures with some machine learning related datasets and a real-world problem of marketing, and the techniques proposed here are shown to improve the generalization properties of other KBs obtained from crisp training data. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The current chapter presents an integrated approach towards the enrichment of a scene modeling information system with intelligent characteristics with respect to user preferences. The aim is to set a framework for this purpose covering the entire range of the scene modeling process, from the abstract definition to the final visual outcome. Necessary notions from preference modeling, decision analysis and machine learning are presented. Inherent difficulties of the current context are exposed and addressed.

abstract={For the outranking relation theory, the ELECTRE methods are one of the most extensively used outranking methods. To measure the degree of agreement and the degree of disagreement of the proposition "one alternative outranks another alternative", the concordance and discordance relations are usually associated with the outranking relation. Instead of the traditional single-layer perceptron (SLP) developed according to the multiple-attribute utility theory, this paper contributes to develop a novel ELECTRE-based SLP for multicriteria classification problems based on the ELECTRE methods involving pairwise comparisons among patterns. A genetic-algorithm-based method is then designed to determine connection weights. A real-world data set involving bankruptcy analysis obtained from Moody's Industrial Manuals is employed to examine the classification performance of the proposed ELECTRE-based model. The results demonstrate that the proposed model performs well compared to an arsenal of well-known classification methods involving quantitative disciplines of statistics and machine learning. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Fuzzy rule-based classification systems (FRBCSs) are able to design interpretable classifiers but suffer from the curse of dimensionality when dealing with complex problems with a large number of features. In this contribution we explore the use of popular approaches for designing ensembles of classifiers in the machine learning field, bagging and random subspace, to design FRBCS multiclassifiers from a basic, heuristic fuzzy classification rule generation method, aiming to both improve their accuracy and to make them able to deal with high dimensional classification problems. Besides, a multicriteria genetic algorithm is proposed to select the component classifiers in the ensemble guided by the cumulative likelihood in order to look for an appropriate accuracy-complexity trade-off. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a maximum separation margin (MSM) training method for multiple-prototype(MP)-based pattern classifiers in which a sample separation margin defined as the distance from the training sample to the classification boundary can be calculated precisely. Similar to support vector machine (SVM) methodology, MSM training is formulated as a multicriteria optimization problem which aims at maximizing the separation margin and minimizing the empirical error rate on training data simultaneously. By making certain relaxation assumptions, MSM training can be reformulated as a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem that can be solved efficiently by some standard optimization algorithms designed for SDP. Evaluation experiments are conducted on the task of the recognition of most confusable Kanji character pairs identified from popular Nakayosi and Kuchibue handwritten Japanese character databases. It is observed that the MSM-trained MP-based classifier achieves a similar character recognition accuracy as that of the state-of-the-art SVM-based classifier, yet requires much fewer classifier parameters. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper we introduce a tool aimed at assisting composers in orchestration tasks. Thanks to this tool, composers can specify a target sound and replicate it with a given orchestra. We discuss the problems raised by the realization of such a tool, concerning instrumental sound description and combinatorial optimization. Then we describe the solution adopted. We propose a machine learning method based on generative probabilistic modeling to represent and generalize instrument timbre possibilities from sample databases. This model allows to deduce the timbre of any mixture of instrument sounds. In a second part, we show that search of sound mixtures that match a given target is a combinatorial optimization problem that can be addressed with multicriteria genetic algorithms.},

abstract={The aim of Feature Subset Selection - FSS - algorithms is to select a subset of features from the original set of features that describes a data set according to some importance criterion. To accomplish this task, FSS removes irrelevant and/or redundant features, as they may decrease data quality and reduce several of the desired properties of classifiers induced by supervised learning algorithms. As learning the best subset of features is an NP-hard problem, FSS algorithms generally use heuristics to select subsets. Therefore, it is important to empirically evaluate the performance of these algorithms. However, this evaluation needs to be multicriteria, i.e., it should take into account several properties. This work describes a simple model we have proposed to evaluate FSS algorithms which considers two properties, namely the predictive performance of the classifier induced using the subset of features selected by different FSS algorithms, as well as the reduction in the number of features. Another multicriteria performance evaluation model based on rankings, which makes it possible to consider any number of properties is also presented. The models are illustrated by their application to four well known FSS algorithms and two versions of a new FSS algorithm we have developed.

abstract={The objective of this paper is to present a systematic procedure to support environmental engineers during the evaluation of alternative options, identifying both, the strong and weak points of their decisions. The evaluation of alternative options in the design of environmental systems is complex because several objectives must be considered simultaneously (e.g. environmental, technical, economical, legal), i.e. the problem is multicriteria. The systematic procedure presented consists of three steps: 1) multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), where the best alternative is selected among the most promising options by evaluating the degree of accomplishment of several design objectives; 2) sensitivity analysis, where multidimensional response surfaces are generated to represent the variation of the selected option with respect to the relative importance of the design objectives; and 3) data analysis through the application of classification trees. The resulting set of rules highlights the relationship amongst the design objectives and the selected alternative without requiring a detailed examination of data values. The capability of this new procedure is demonstrated with a case study where the bioreactor of a wastewater treatment plant is designed to achieve simultaneous carbon and nitrogen removal. The results demonstrate how this new procedure supports the systematic evaluation of alternative options during the conceptual design of environmental processes.},

abstract={The problem of group ranking, also known as rank aggregation, has been studied in contexts varying from sports, to multicriteria decision making, to machine learning, to ranking Web pages, and to behavioral issues. The dynamics of the group aggregation of individual decisions has been a subject of central importance in decision theory. We present here a new paradigm using an optimization framework that addresses major shortcomings that exist in current models of group ranking. Moreover, the framework provides a specific performance measure for the quality of the aggregate ranking as per its deviations from the individual decision-makers' rankings. The new model for the group-ranking problem presented here is based on rankings provided with intensity- that is, the degree of preference is quantified. The model allows for flexibility in decision protocols and can take into consideration imprecise beliefs, less than full confidence in some of the rankings, and differentiating between the expertise of the reviewers. Our approach relaxes frequently made assumptions of: certain beliefs in pairwise rankings; homogeneity implying equal expertise of all decision makers with respect to all evaluations; and full list requirement according to which each decision maker evaluates and ranks all objects. The option of preserving the ranks in certain subsets is also addressed in the model here. Significantly, our model is a natural extension and generalization of existing models, yet it is solvable in polynomial time. The group-rankings models are linked to network flow techniques. ©2006 INFORMS.},

abstract={The MultiCAD platform is a system that accepts the declarative description of a scene (e.g. a building) as input and generates the geometric descriptions that comply with the specific description. Its goal is to facilitate the transition from the intuitive hierarchical decomposition of the scene to its concrete geometric representation. The aim of the present work is to provide the existing system with an intelligent module that will capture, store and apply user preferences in order to eventually automate the task of solution selection. A combination of two components based on decision support and artificial intelligence methodologies respectively are currently being implemented. A method is also proposed for the fair and efficient comparison of the results.},

abstract={The classification problem statement of multicriteria decision analysis is to model the classification of the alternatives/actions according to the decision maker's preferences. These models are based on outranking relations, utility functions or (linear) discriminant functions. Model parameters can be given explicitly or learnt from a preclassified set of alternatives/actions. In this paper we propose a novel approach, the Continuous Decision (CD) method, to learn parameters of a discriminant function, and we also introduce its extension, the Continuous Decision Tree (CDT) method, which describes the classification more accurately. The proposed methods are results of integration of Machine Learning methods in Decision Analysis. From a Machine Learning point of view, the CDT method can be considered as an extension of the C4.5 decision tree building algorithm that handles only numeric criteria but applies more complex tests in the inner nodes of the tree. For the sake of easier interpretation, the decision trees are transformed to rules. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper concerns the design and development of an adaptive planner that is able to adjust its parameters to the characteristics of a given problem and to the priorities set by the user concerning plan length and planning time. This is accomplished through the implementation of the k nearest neighbor machine learning algorithm on top of a highly adjustable planner, called HAP. Learning data are produced by running HAP offline on several problems from multiple domains using all value combinations of its parameters. When the adaptive planner HAPNN is faced with a new problem, it locates the k nearest problems, using a set of measurable problem characteristics, retrieves the performance data for all parameter configurations on these problems and performs a multicriteria combination, with user-specified weights for plan length and planning time. Based on this combination, the configuration with the best performance is then used in order to solve the new problem. Comparative experiments with the statistically best static configurations of the planner show that HAPNN manages to adapt successfully to unseen problems, leading to an increased planning performance.},

abstract={In dynamic real-time control (RTC) of regional water systems, a multicriteria optimization problem has to be solved to determine the optimal control strategy. Nonlinear and/or dynamic programming based on simulation models can be used to find the solution, an approach being used in the Aquarius decision support system (DSS) developed in The Netherlands. However, the computation time required for complex models is often prohibitively long, and therefore such a model cannot be applied in RTC of water systems. In this study, Aquarius DSS is chosen as a reference model for building a controller using machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and reinforcement learning (RL), where RL is used to decrease the error of the ANN-based component. The model was tested with complex water systems in The Netherlands, and very good results were obtained. The general conclusion is that a controller, which has learned to replicate the optimal control strategy, can be used in RTC operations.},

abstract={In this paper, we will introduce a generic, multicriteria model based on fuzzy logic concepts for decision support systems. Our goal is to build such a model by 1) fitting real-world data and 2) representing the preferences of specific-domain users or experts., Toward this en4 we used Evolutionary Computation techniques. Initially, we worked on a first order aggregation model and performed its learning using Genetic Algorithms. This has been used in a specific application related to university admissions. Then, we propose a more advanced multi-aggregation model based on decision trees. For the learning process of this model, we developed a technique inspired from Genetic Programming.},

abstract={We present a meta-learning method to support selection of candidate learning algorithms. It uses a k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to identify the datasets that are most similar to the one at hand. The distance between datasets is assessed using a relatively small set of data characteristics, which was selected to represent properties that affect algorithm performance. The performance of the candidate algorithms on those datasets is used to generate a recommendation to the user in the form of a ranking. The performance is assessed using a multicriteria evaluation measure that takes not only accuracy, but also time into account. As it is not common in Machine Learning to work with rankings, we had to identify and adapt existing statistical techniques to devise an appropriate evaluation methodology. Using that methodology, we show that the meta-learning method presented leads to significantly better rankings than the baseline ranking method. The evaluation methodology is general and can be adapted to other ranking problems. Although here we have concerned on ranking classification algorithms, the meta-learning framework presented can provide assistance in the selection of combinations of methods or more complex problem solving strategies.},

abstract={The primary objective in the discrimination problem is to assign a set of alternatives into predefined classes. During the last two decades several new approaches, such as mathematical programming, neural networks, machine learning, rough sets, multi-criteria decision aid (MCDA), etc., have been proposed to overcome the shortcomings of traditional, statistical and econometric techniques that have dominated this field since the 1930s. This paper focuses on the MCDA approach. A new method to achieve multi-group discrimination based on an iterative binary segmentation procedure is proposed. Five real world applications from the field of finance (credit cards assessment, country risk evaluation, credit risk assessment, corporate acquisitions, business failure prediction) are used to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method as opposed to discriminant analysis. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={In industrial production processes, materials and different forms of energy are provided, converted, stored and transported. Environmental impacts can be identified at any stage of the energy and material flow process. Due to the fact that production units and processes are interconnected with energy and material flows, it is of special interest to develop production control mechanisms, which control the energy and material streams so that available resources are utilised most efficiently and reduce emissions and by-products caused by the production process. Methodical production control strategies can be based on optimal algorithms, production rules or methods of machine learning. Due to the complexity of real production systems, it is advisable to use heuristic approaches. In order to analyse the behaviour of different control strategies, the developed systems are verified by an exemplary production system from the textile industry, consisting of a dye house, a hydro-power, a boiler house, and a flue gas neutralisation facility. A verification of the developed systems shows that Fuzzy Expert Systems, Neural Networks, and Neuro-Fuzzy approaches can be applied for the controlling of energy and material flows, taking into account economic and emission orientated goals. The selection of a certain approach mainly depends on the structure of the available production knowledge. © 1996 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this paper we present a case evidence generation architecture, CEG, that supports case based decision and knowledge modeling. CEG is a blackboard based system that supports case evidence generation and acquisition. It can be used to define case decision classes, to model case knowledge elements, to represent prototypical case features and cases, to index cases according to decision classes or prototypical case realizations and to model elements of bias or error in case representation. We place CEG in the context of multicriteria decision making and draw architectural components from Machine Learning. We give an overview of CEG and CEG knowledge components. We demonstrate CEG by means of two 'real world' decision making exemplars drawn from retail sales evaluation and medical decision making. Finally, we explore architectural properties and discuss the potential for further research on the subject. © 1995.},
